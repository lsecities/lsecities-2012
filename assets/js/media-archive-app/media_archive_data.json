Each panel member will discuss the primary factors within their respective areas of expertise (urban educational systems, municipal government law) which contribute to poverty and inequality. We also hope they will offer some prescriptions for decision-makers for overcoming these challenges and moving the economy toward more equitable outcomes.\n\nPlease join us over lunch in a free-flowing and lively discussion addressing the issue of how a sustainable, global, and productive metro economy has the potential to lessen the material and social inequalities of vulnerable households and neighborhoods.","blurb_after_event":"","event_description":"","contact_info":"","hashtag":"","storify_id":"","galleria_photo_gallery":"","external_uri":""},"session_speakers":false,"session_chairs":false,"session_respondents":false,"related_event":{"title":"The Next Metro Economy: Confronting the Persistent Challenges of Cities","series":[]},"event_speakers":[{"id":"168","name":"Andrew","created":"2011-12-15 00:38:55","modified":"2014-01-10 12:10:37","slug":"altman-andrew","family_name":"Altman","title":"","email_address":"","photo_legacy":"","profile_text":"Andy Altman is a\u00a0Visiting Senior Fellow at LSE Cities and former Chief Executive, London Legacy Development Corporation 2009-2012.","organization":"LSE Cities","role":"Visiting Senior Fellow","additional_affiliations":"","qualifications":"","staff_pages_blurb":"Andrew Altman is a\u00a0Visiting Senior Fellow at LSE Cities.

Improving urban health in Africa is a major challenge, given 70 per cent of urban dwellers presently live in informal settlements, facing a triple or quadruple disease burden: poverty-related diseases, emerging chronic disease, injuries and HIV\/AIDS. This public lecture explored the future of urban health in Africa, asking whether and how we might move towards healthy African cities, including by re-thinking planning and design.<\/p>\n\n<p>The second lecture in this series <a href=\"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/media\/objects\/events\/interdisciplinary-action-for-urban-health\">'Interdisciplinary Perspectives for Healthy Cities<\/a>' will be on 26 April 2013 18.30 -
