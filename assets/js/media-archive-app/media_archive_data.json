It was chaired by Ricky Burdett and will host major figures within urban planning, design and architecture: <b>Peter Rees<\/b>, Head Planner of the City of London, <b>Eric Parry<\/b>, Architect (Eric Parry Architects) and <strong>Keith Bradshaw<\/strong>, Light Designer (Speirs+Major).","event_description":"","contact_info":"","hashtag":"","storify_id":"LSECities\/lselight","picasa_gallery_id":"","external_uri":"","free_form_event_date":null,"photo_gallery_credits":null},"session_speakers":false,"session_chairs":false,"session_respondents":false,"related_event":{"title":"Configuring Light\/ Staging the Social: Lighting London","series":[]},"event_speakers":[{"id":"519","name":"Keith","created":"2014-04-03 11:42:54","modified":"2014-04-03 11:42:54","slug":"bradshaw-keith","family_name":"Bradshaw","title":"","email_address":"","photo_legacy":null,"profile_text":"Keith Bradshaw is principal at Speirs+Major, a UK lighting design practice which is\u00a0 noted for its illumination of prominent buildings, including Barajas International Airport, 30 St Mary Axe and the Millennium Dome.

By focusing on the spatial politics of land claims, processes of home-making and un-making, and logics of speculation and dispossession, speakers will highlight the discourses and practices that shape future land security and insecurity.

This is party because Greater Mumbai, the city proper, occupies 438 km2 yet is often confused with the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, which is almost ten times bigger (4,355 km2) and includes the outlying townships of Kalyan and Thane, which are 1 million-plus cities in their own right.<\/p>\n<p>There is confusion, too, over the population and, as a corollary, the extent of migration. Many experts conjure up images of a city bursting at the seams, yet more than two decades ago, an authoritative study for the Planning Commission, led by Rakesh Mohan, showed that India\u2019s urban growth is in fact not rapid when compared to the international developing country standards of Africa and Latin America. Soon after, the National Commission on Urbanisation, headed by Charles Correa, reiterated this and noted that unlike many other South and South-East Asian countries, India\u2019s urban growth was evenly spread throughout the country. In the highly urbanised state of Maharashtra, the cities of Pune, Nashik and Nagpur are growing far faster than Mumbai. This is partly because India, unlike many of its neighbours, does not have a primate city.<\/p>\n<p>Political parties and some NGOs have raised the spectre of hordes of migrants pouring into Mumbai but the truth has been different. People do not stream into Mumbai because of its bright lights; they come for jobs, not homes, and they live in far worse conditions once they get here. According to the International Institute of Population Studies, only 480 people \u2013 not families, as is commonly mistaken \u2013 come into the city every day. According to the last census in 2001, Greater Mumbai had a population of just under 12 million; thus it has presumably a population of somewhere close to 15 or 16 million now. Migration as a proportion of the total population is also declining. In the 1970s, the proportion of migrants was close to 70 per cent with a natural increase of 30 per cent. The proportions have now reversed. This is no surprise, considering that formal employment in the city is declining, with the closure of mills, chemical factories and even some multinational industries.<\/p>\n<p>While the rate of growth may not be dramatic, size does matter. The outlying areas of the metropolitan region are expanding faster than the core, especially the 100 km2 of the island city. According to the Washington-based Population Institute, the metropolitan region in 2020 will be the world\u2019s most populous at 28.5 million, with Tokyo trailing at 27.3 million.<\/p>\n<p>Whatever direction Mumbai takes will have a bearing on the future of cities in developing countries. This is partly due to its sheer size, but also its diversity, its specific problems (housing and transport being two of the most pressing) and, not least, the democratic framework in which it functions. There is a sharp contrast with China in general and Shanghai in particular, with which it is frequently compared, with regards to the last issue.<\/p>\n<p>Yet to project Mumbai as a \u2018world-class city\u2019 turns a blind eye to its priorities, mainly the overwhelming poverty of its citizens. One must remember that India, despite its nearly two-digit GDP growth, is home to the largest number of poor people in the world. And there is no city in the country with as large a proportion of its residents living in slums, officially put at 54 per cent or nearly 6.5 million people in Greater Mumbai.<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-158\" title=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/10\/07_ref_A%20Matter%20of%20People21.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"396\" height=\"700\" \/><\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">A second problem is the astronomical price of real estate, especially for commercial space, in the two central business districts of Nariman Point and the Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC). Recent reports about Nariman Point losing out to its competitors in the north and the impending real-estate boom on mill land in midtown Mumbai must be understood in conjunction with the fact that in upmarket areas, a single-bedroom flat is virtually impossible to find. Indeed, Mumbai has the unique distinction of possessing less than one acre of open space for every thousand people, while the norm is (4 acres) (or 0.016 km2).<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Dharavi, said to be Asia\u2019s largest slum, lies cheek-by-jowl with the Bandra-Kurla complex and has attracted nearly 80 real estate giants in the redevelopment bid for the Rs.9,250 crore (US$234.65 million) 0.4 km2, new high-rise township. This negates the rationale of resettlement, because it ignores Dharavi as a work-cum-living space. As one of the most intensive recycling centres in the county, residents in Dharavi use their homes to sort and sew in addition to hundreds of other occupations. With the redevelopment scheme currently proposed, they will likely be unable to afford the monthly maintenance charges in the new high-rise redevelopment and will instead sell out to move to another slum colony.<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">In effect, Dharavi\u2019s squatted-upon land will be privatised and gentrified. All this has a bearing on the governance of Mumbai. There have been calls to establish Mumbai as a separate city-state \u2013 a la Singapore \u2013 seceded from the rest of Maharashtra, not to mention India. Although appropriating a larger share of the income and corporate taxes paid in the city, this would be dangerous because it militates against the very essence of the democratic process. This apart, the collection of direct taxes is disproportionately high because head-offices of companies with nation-wide operations are based in the city (although the amount of personal tax evaded may form a large proportion of the revenue). The object should be to bring about a more cohesive integration of Mumbai into Maharashtra \u2013 so that, for instance, some Rs 15,000 crores (US$378.8 million) are not spent on road projects in the city but diverted to irrigation and other schemes in Vidarbha and other depressed regions where farmers have been committing suicide in recent years.<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The call for a CEO for Mumbai should also be treated with caution. Mumbai is not a corporate entity which lends itself to better corporate governance but a highly variegated and diverse city. As any Municipal Commissioner will testify, there are pulls and pressures at every move from political parties which are represented in the corporation. The city could certainly be run better and there is no reason why a hands-on mayor cannot be elected to do the job, as is the case in New York and London. Doing so might also address the allegation that the constituency of the state government is in rural areas with ministers treating Mumbai as a cash cow; for although Maharashtra, like the rest of India, is still a predominantly rural society, it should be administered in a more comprehensive, rather than exclusionary, way.<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Executives of US companies with a market cap of over US$1 trillion recently held a closed-door meeting in New York with their Indian counterparts. The agenda was to make Mumbai a major financial centre, yet the dilemma in projecting Mumbai as a world-class city excludes people from this process. In the demonisation of slum dwellers, sought to be disenfranchised by politicians and community leaders, decision-makers posit a \u2018them\u2019 versus \u2018us\u2019 dichotomy. However, if the homeless are a majority, they surely deserve to be accorded a priority in planning.<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Public transport is an illustrative case-in-point. In this mega city, more people use public transport than anywhere else in the world. Only 4.7 per cent of commuters use private motorised transport, 7 per cent use taxis and auto rickshaws and an overwhelming majority, 39 per cent, use public transport. World Bank studies show that on top of that as many as 56.3 per cent walk or cycle to work; an appropriately high number given that more than half the population lives in slums and close to 70 per cent of all Mumbaikars occupy just one room. This compares to a total of 81 per cent of public transport users in Tokyo.<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.urban-age.net\/0_images\/07_ref_A%20Matter%20of%20People3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"190\" height=\"285\" align=\"right\" border=\"0\" \/>The Centre for Science and Environment in New Delhi has shown that a car requires 23 m2 to park, including the space needed for entry and exit. Since Delhi has as many car users (920,723 registered) as the rest of the three metro system users put together, it estimates that the physical space occupied by cars equals that of the capital\u2019s slum dwellers. Since Mumbai\u2019s squatters occupy only 9 per cent of the city\u2019s area, it would be interesting to know what proportion is occupied by cars. More importantly, one wonders which is a bigger nuisance? And who are vilified in the public discourse?<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Mumbai can opt for inclusive growth. It can also go the way of several other megacities by creating high-rise enclaves for the rich and powerful, surrounded by a mass of poor and powerless citizens. One hopes the Urban Age India conference raises some of these fundamental issues.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":null,"article_publishing_date":"November 2007","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"45","name":"Darryl","created":"2011-10-07 14:20:48","modified":"2011-10-07 15:20:48","slug":null,"family_name":"D'Monte","title":null,"email_address":null,"photo_legacy":null,"profile_text":"","organization":"","role":"","additional_affiliations":null,"qualifications":null,"staff_pages_blurb":null,"office_location":null,"display_after":null,"display_until":null,"extended_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb_lang2":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation_lang2":null,"phone_number":null}],"attachments":false,"gallery":{"slug":false,"extra_classes":"","slides":[]}},{"request_language":"","current_page_uri":"\/media\/search-dev.json","lang2_slug":false,"lang2_name":false,"parent_publication_id":10,"featured_image_uri":"","article_title":"A \u2018Rule of Law\u2019 for Cities","permalink":"a-rule-of-law-for-cities","article_subtitle":"","article_abstract":"<p>By illustrating the complexities and contradictions of power structures in city governance, Gerald Frug exposes the limitations of formal and informal legal systems, arguing that the future stability of cities ultimately rests with the power of local democracy.<\/p>\n","article_summary":"","article_text":"<p><div id=\"attachment_150\" style=\"width: 1290px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-150\" src=\"http:\/\/v1.lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/10\/nyc-CENTRAL-PARK_RICHARD-BERENHOLTZ.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"423\" \/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">New York City\u2019s Central Park is surrounded by high-rise towers and Manhattan\u2019s dense urban grid. The 3.41 km2 (843 acre) park was created in the mid-nineteenth century to provide a place of refuge for the city\u2019s rapidly expanding population.<\/p><\/div>\n<p>The core value I associate with the rule of law is the need to restrain the exercise of arbitrary power \u2013 the need to protect the weak against the strong. Many people most easily recognise the importance of this task when they think about the arbitrariness that derives from the power wielded by governments \u2013 not only by authoritarian governments but by democracies too. But government is not the only problem. There are also dangers posed by the private sector. To protect against the power of employers and financial institutions, we rely on the government to prohibit employment discrimination, regulate financial markets, and penalise fraud, to mention only a few examples. To protect against the arbitrary power wielded by other private individuals, we seek government action to restrain violence and intimidation.<\/p>\n<p>Protection from these sources of arbitrary power is always incomplete and imperfect. But more worrisome than this incompleteness is the fact that the combination of the two roles for the rule of law that I\u2019ve mentioned \u2013 the need to restrain governmental power and the need to restrain private power \u2013 contradict each other. We rely on the government to regulate the market and to punish anti-social activity, and, at the same time, we seek to limit governmental power. We seek both to empower government and to disempower it. We seek both to empower private discretion and to regulate it. This contradictory structure is a fundamental building block of the formal legal system. The formal system makes a major contribution to the protection against arbitrary power when it establishes rules that seek to resolve the difficulties and ambiguities produced by this contradictory structure.<\/p>\n<p>Relying on the formal system, even at its best, however, is an insufficient way to restrain arbitrary power. I shall attempt to explain why by addressing two very different aspects of city life. The first is the part of the city that the formal legal system currently does not adequately address \u2013 best illustrated by the informal economy and informal housing so prevalent in the developing world. The second is an aspect of city policy that the formal legal system regulates in detail: decisions about urban economic development.<\/p>\n<p>Speaking recently of an informal neighbourhood in Cairo, a New York Times reporter wrote that the residents see government as \u2018an utterly unreliable source of help for the average citizen.\u2019 This is not surprising, because the informal economy and informal housing result from the government\u2019s withdrawal from portions of the economy and the housing sector, leaving them unregulated, untaxed, and unprotected. The informal housing in Mumbai and other cities is built without legal permission and is not in compliance with legal standards. The informal economy includes people engaged in unregulated activities such as building the housing, selling food and other commodities, and providing services such as transportation by vans or rickshaws. One form of arbitrary power threatening these informal activities is exercised by the government: large-scale, mass evictions that drive people from their homes, and, equally importantly, deprive them of their economic livelihood. But the government\u2019s intervention is intermittent. Sometimes the government adopts the opposite policy, seeking instead to improve services to the informal sector rather than eliminating it. The more pervasive form of arbitrary power is exercised by landlords taking advantage of those who rent housing from them, criminal gangs seeking to skim money from local vendors, and the police and other officials taking payoffs to look the other way when these abuses occur. The informal sector is filled with people who pay money for housing, depend for their livelihood on a particular location for their stall, and rely on access to transportation and infrastructure. If trouble arises, the formal legal system is not there to help them. Calling in the police is not an answer because the police can often be the problem.<\/p>\n<p>It is important to recognise that the informal economy and the informal housing sector, as I have just described them, are set up in accordance with law. By this I mean that the law sets up rules of formality \u2013 licenses to operate businesses, building codes for housing, zoning laws, taxation schemes \u2013 and these rules define the limit of legality. Those outside these limits are by definition illegal. For that reason, they are vulnerable both to public and private power. Having been declared illegal, violators are subject at any time to the penalties of illegality. But these penalties can be and often are withheld. This withholding of sanctions is what enables the street peddlers to work and those living in the shacks to call them home. This system empowers the people with the authority to forgive violations \u2013 those who decide that the penalties established by the legal system will not be imposed. The problem is that these officials can change their mind at any time.<\/p>\n<p>One response to this current structure is the idea of extending the formal legal system to everything that now is located in the informal system. This would mean bringing all housing and economic transactions within legal requirements \u2013 regulating them, bringing them up to code, subjecting them to taxation, giving them the rights of property owners. In many parts of the world, this simply cannot be done. The government does not have the resources or capacity to create a totally formal world. Indeed, it is because of its inability to provide housing that informal housing has become so widespread. And it is because of its inability to create an economic system that provides enough jobs that the growth of the informal economy has been so substantial. This is a familiar point to people living in developing cities around the rule, from Mumbai to Mexico City. But even in the U.K. and the United States, bringing every element into the formal system \u2013 every illegal immigrant working as a maid, every business transaction made off the books, every building not strictly in compliance with the regulatory codes \u2013 is unachievable.<\/p>\n<p>We have to come up with another option. The one I would like to suggest is local democracy. The basic idea is to empower neighbourhood people themselves, working collectively, to intervene against the power of corrupt police, landlords, and the criminal underworld. This would require the decentralisation to the neighbourhood level of two kinds of authority: the ability to make rules that limit the current forms of abuse and the ability to resolve the disputes that arise under the new rules. These are familiar rule of law tasks. Instead of assigning them to lawyers, judges or other professionals, however, I see the establishment of basic rules as an example of neighbourhood self-government. The analogy is to the legislature. I see the application of the rules as an example of empowering ordinary people to make decisions about disputes in their own community. The analogy is to the jury. Both institutional forms can be vehicles for involving ordinary citizens in the experience of protecting people from the exercise of arbitrary power. More than that, they can enable ordinary people to assert some control over their own lives \u2013 control that can begin by limiting the kinds of exposure imposed by some neighbourhood residents over those who are even more vulnerable. This process can then lead to another form of power: it can contribute to political organizing so that, when the danger arises from the city or state governments rather than from fellow residents, the neighbourhood would be better prepared to confront it.<\/p>\n<p>I am not proposing a form of community empowerment disconnected from the legal system. I am proposing a new kind of institution that would fit within and that would strengthen the legal system. Like the rest of the legal system, any neighbourhood process needs to be subject to institutional checks and balances. No rule of law regime enables a group of people to exercise unchecked power. The issue here \u2013 very similar to the one that confronts the formal legal system \u2013 is how to give the decision makers enough authority so that they can be empowered, while, at the same time, limiting the dangers of abuse that they themselves impose. This is the problem involved when the legal system subjects city decision making to state or national oversight, subjects jury judgments to judicial and appellate review, and subjects legislative judgments to declarations of their unconstitutionality. Moreover, the role of outsiders is not just to limit power in the name of checking abuse. It is also to reinforce neighbourhood power by providing assistance in cases that the neighbourhood can\u2019t handle. Sometimes neighbourhood residents may be too vulnerable to retribution by powerful actors in the community to be able to make a decision. Still, the structure I am proposing is not just an addition to the traditional formal legal system. It is also a modification of it. As I have stressed, the decision makers would be ordinary people, not lawyers or judges or experts.<\/p>\n<p>To understand the system I have in mind better, I turn now to the second situation I mentioned earlier, one far from the neighbourhoods in my first example. I am talking about the places where the government and developers are concentrating their efforts to further the economic growth of cities. I mean places like Canary Wharf in London, the Santa Fe neighbourhood in Mexico City, and the Mill area in Mumbai. These are not places, like the sites for the informal sector, designed to be marginal. They are to be the heart of the city economy, and, as a result, they are the places where the formal legal system is most in evidence. The way that the current legal system structures these developments is not the same everywhere, so to discuss the process requires engaging in generalization, indeed, over-generalization. But it usually takes the form of three legally-constituted negotiations: one between the city and the developer, another between the two of them and the surrounding neighbourhood, and the third involving efforts by all interested parties to get approvals from other regulatory government bodies, often at the state or national level. These three negotiations create an enormously complex process. Legal rules affect every part of it. Yet, it seems to me, the most important issue that these developments raise is not addressed by the legal system at all.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_151\" style=\"width: 1290px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-151\" src=\"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/10\/Aerial_LINKE_Mexico-City.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"576\" \/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The fl at eastern edge of Mexico City\u2019s dispersed urban landscape is populated by informal settlements such as Nezahualc\u00f3yotl. Ciudad Neza, as it is commonly referred, has a population of over 1.1 million in low-income housing.<\/p><\/div>\n<p>The focus of the negotiation between the developer and the government is the devising of a formula that allows the developer to make enough money to be willing to sign the deal and enables the government to accomplish enough of its objectives to be willing to go along. The government\u2019s focus might be on the accommodation of affordable housing, the size of the buildings, the need for improvements to the infrastructure, or other similar matters; the developer is likely to be focused principally on the bottom line. The deal with the neighbourhood is different. The neighbours have to be persuaded not to try to block the project, so enough has to be offered to them to buy their compliance (even if, ultimately, they will be forced to move out of the neighbourhood). The regulatory authorities will have still other objectives \u2013 very often environmental concerns, but they can involve almost any aspect of regulatory power. These additional regulatory requirements are often used strategically by opponents of the development to attack a deal they are against on other grounds. If these three negotiations are concluded successfully, the deal is blessed as consistent with governing law.<\/p>\n<p>Does this process allow the exercise of arbitrary power? I think it does. The source of arbitrariness can vary. Sometime it can come from the government when it interprets the legal rules to allow the developer exemptions from standard practice \u2013 or when it interprets the law to prohibit the developer from doing something it might just as easily have allowed. Sometimes it is the neighbourhood, operating under the legitimating cloak of the word \u2018community,\u2019 that can hold up a project by demands that outsiders would consider unreasonable. Sometimes, it can come from the architects, when they seek to defend the unchallengeable creativity of their design. Sometimes it can be based on a disputable invocation of environmental or other rules. Since the background legal framework does not determine the result of any of the negotiations, there is a considerable amount of individual discretion exercised in all of them. The formal rules are often crafted precisely to allow this discretion, thereby circumventing the popular protest that another process might have produced.<\/p>\n<p>The overarching question left out of this process is whether the current economic development strategy embraced by these projects will improve the lives of the majority of people affected by them. This is not a question to be negotiated with developers. It is also not likely to be addressed by the detailed technical objections lodged with regulatory agencies. And it is not a question appropriately answered by the neighbourhood where the development is located. The current assumption in planning circles about popular involvement is that the relevant \u2018community\u2019 to evaluate development decisions is the neighbourhood, and not the larger population. One can understand why people think this. After all, a development is likely to have a very significant impact on people living nearby. But that is also reason why the neighbourhood might be the wrong focus group. The way neighbourhoods evaluate their future is likely to be different than a city-wide evaluation. Change has to take place somewhere, and if every neighbourhood parochially resists it, it will be prevented from happening.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps, however, the overall question of economic policy is handled by the public sector in the negotiations. After all, the public sector itself, and not just the neighbourhood, is always one of the negotiating parties. Often, however, it is not the city that represents the public. Instead, it is a public authority, public corporation, or quango that has been carefully organised to be less responsive to democratic decision making than the city itself. Even when the city is involved, the desire for attracting investment can overwhelm executive officials. They often feel that the city is so threatened by competition with other cities, so desperate to get the deal done, that an examination and debate about the conception of the city\u2019s future that the deal is fostering would seem a distraction.<\/p>\n<p>Another basic problem with the current negotiation structure is that the focus is on land use. But much more is at stake in development decisions than how land is to be used. Even more important is the idea of the city that the proposed development will foster \u2013 the kind of population the city is trying to attract, retain, and exclude by adopting this particular definition of economic growth. Most of the major projects I\u2019m thinking about are focused on pursuing the image of being a global city. This means attracting finance, high-tech, and international investment, and therefore providing the office buildings, high-end shopping, and secluded housing complexes that these target audiences are thought to demand. Those who are pursuing this agenda rarely have to defend it before representatives of the city as a whole. They rarely have to articulate how this strategy will improve the lives of most city residents.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why I think that we need to open up the contestability of economic development policy \u2013 like the organization of informal neighbourhoods &#8212; to a democratically organised institution. Unlike my proposal for the informal sector, I think that the institution should represent people city-wide, rather than be neighbourhood-focused. In some cities, this can be done by giving greater authority over development to the city\u2019s legislative body \u2013 its city council or assembly. If the local legislature is not now adequate, another organisation will have to be established. The role of the democratic process should not be to offer advice and criticism to experts. The participants should be empowered to establish the city\u2019s strategy for economic growth, with the experts advising the decision makers rather being the decision makers. The goal is to include the very people left out in the reigning economic development strategy in the decision making about what that strategy should be. These are the people who most need to be protected by the rule of law. As was the case for the neighbourhood process for the informal sector, I see the new institution as an integral part of the existing legal structure, not independent of it. It adds new voices to the legal structure. It too needs to be subject to a system of checks and balances. To give unrestrained decision making power to any particular group would enable arbitrary power, rather than limit it. The goal of the new institution is to empower the people not now in the process to be able to make decisions not now adequately addressed.<\/p>\n<p>In my view, my proposal dealing with economic development and my earlier proposal about informal neighbourhoods constitute one agenda not two. For me, the most vulnerable residents of major cities around the world are threatened by events in two very different parts of town. Some of their vulnerability derives from the neighbourhoods where they live; some comes from the effect on their lives produced by the pursuit of development elsewhere in the city. The changes I propose to the way we now organise the rule of law in our cities are designed to protect these people from decisions made regarding either kind of neighbourhood. This is not just a necessity for the developing world. Although London and New York City are justly proud of the immigrants who have become a major part of their population, their views are rarely represented in the debates about the city\u2019s future. To address this omission, I propose a more democratic form of the rule of law.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":null,"article_publishing_date":"November 2007","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"43","name":"Gerald","created":"2011-10-07 13:22:02","modified":"2013-10-15 18:20:22","slug":"frug-gerald","family_name":"Frug","title":"","email_address":"","photo_legacy":"\/0_images\/02-GFrug.jpg","profile_text":"Louis D.

He returns to this theme in this newspaper for the Urban Age conference in Rio de Janeiro by framing the debate on cities as a contrast between <em>efficiency<\/em> and <em>sociability<\/em>. This duality is at the heart of the investigation of the interrelationships between the social and the physical in cities, which since 2005 have shaped the explorations of the Urban Age programme at LSE Cities.<\/p>\n<p>For the Rio Urban Age conference we have focussed on the impact of radical transformations in cities that have reshaped \u2013 at times drastically \u2013 the spatial, social and economic landscape of urban centres across the globe. We have used the opportunity of Rio\u2019s intense pace and scale of change to reflect on the social and creative energies of urban form at different scales and levels, in an attempt to understand how they affect patterns of everyday urban life, in positive and negative ways. We are interested in finding out whether the streets, blocks and infrastructure networks being built today are guiding us to more equitable, efficient and more civic lives, or are working against the grain of that elusive quality of <em>cityness<\/em>, fostering divisiveness and inequality in the rush to build and compete.<\/p>\n<p>This publication is designed to contribute to the debate with texts and research by over twenty leading urban commentators, academics, policymakers and practitioners investigating the recent transformations of cities like Rio, London, Barcelona, Mumbai, Bogot\u00e1, Hamburg and Cape Town. It contains new research carried out by LSE Cities, comparing the social, economic and spatial characteristics of Rio de Janeiro with other global cities, and provides detailed analysis of the changing physiognomy of cities and projects in selected urban areas. The objective of the newspaper and the conference it supports is to ask a number of key questions. What are the drivers of these physical transformations and the global political economies that are emerging behind these building programmes? What long-term dependencies are such transformations putting before us and how flexible are these forms to social and economic change? How are citizens demanding different infrastructures and questioning the traditional role of markets and the State in delivering big projects?<\/p>\n<p>These same questions were being asked over 150 years ago when London\u2019s Victorian reformers saw fit to improve the health of their citizens by constructing a major sewerage system under their city. What they found was a London subdivided into small territorial interests, unable to take the necessary metropolitan decisions that such a land-thirsty city transformation required. In delivering the project, the Victorians created a new metropolitan authority, the predecessor to London\u2019s first government, the London County Council, founded in 1889. Put in simple terms, the project had the ability to concentrate power away from the vestries and later normalise this new-found power into governing Londoners in the name of greater utility.<\/p>\n<p>Critics like David Harvey and Deyan Sudjic have commented on how these large-scale technical interventions barely conceal a social programme \u2013 from Haussman\u2019s Paris to Robert Moses\u2019s New York. More recently, Carlos Vainer and other commentators have identified similarities with some of the developments taking place in Rio. To implement \u2018big\u2019 plans of large ambitions \u2013 from the Rio 2016 Olympics, the UPP pacification programme, the restructuring of Porto Maravilha and investment in major Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) lines \u2013 the City and State of Rio de Janeiro have developed new institutions to deliver these projects that can be seen to question the \u2018right to the city\u2019.<\/p>\n<p>London has confronted similar issues as it created its own \u2018top-down\u2019 institutions to deliver the 2012 Olympics, ensure its legacy and bring about lasting regeneration in the deprived zones of East London. The Olympic Delivery Authority, and the recently formed London Legacy Development Company (chaired by the Mayor), as Andy Altman explains, are charged with sweeping planning and decision-making powers, even though they have worked in partnership with boroughs and local groups. Despite some level of criticism of democratic deficit, broadly their operation has been applauded for getting the job done. Hamburg\u2019s HafenCity and experimental IBA initiative \u2013 both designed to tackle issues of deindustrialisation and the needs of large migrant communities (most notably Muslim Turks) \u2013 provide relevant models of intervention and delivery that take into account the need to ensure continuity of the urban fabric and the everyday needs of existing (and not just new) communities. All issues which resonate in the urban reality of Rio today.<\/p>\n<p>Brazil\u2019s democratic commitment to the right of the city has been followed by many, including Edgar Pieterse writing in this newspaper, who have long admired the country\u2019s 2001 Statute of the City. This national law seeks to prioritise the social use over the commercial use of land and to democratise the decision-making process in cities through compulsory participatory governance models. Yet, the reality on the ground is different. A large proportion of the urban public believe that mega-projects are tampering with strategic priorities through what Julia Michaels calls a favour-exchanging populist system, putting the private interest over the public good \u2013 tensions that exist as much in New York, London and Amsterdam, as Susan Fainstein argues, as they do in Rio de Janeiro. Despite the significant generational improvements in Rio\u2019s social and economic life \u2013 decreasing levels of inequality and absolute poverty, homicides at a historical low, and GDP per capita double from its 2001 levels \u2013 the anthropologist Luiz Eduardo Soares defines the fine-grain cracks that are appearing in Brazilian society and account for the recent popular discontent and uprisings in Rio, S\u00e3o Paulo and other cities. How can planners, policymakers and designers deal with such contradictions?<\/p>\n<p>The dilemma emerging from London in the 1850s and Rio in the 2010s is how to balance the large economic benefits that often accrue from large-scale projects to the individual and communal rights of citizens. As David Harvey writes in the classic <em>The Right to the City<\/em>, parts of which are reproduced in this newspaper, we need a \u2018collective right to reshape the forces of urbanisation\u2019. There is a very practical dimension to this call that has repercussions to the way projects are designed, procured and delivered. Part of the problem lies in the temporal conflicts that exist between democratic and project timelines. All too often, the collective right of decision-making cannot be practised because the time frame of project cycles do not run apace. A city such as Rio that has not seen major transport investments in over twenty years is having to think of who should be connected and how in the space of only seven years \u2013 the project cycle of an Olympic Games. Democratic processes and strategic planning take much longer.<\/p>\n<p>A second challenge of accelerated transformations occurs when the physical and social fabric of the city has to catch up with structural adjustments and transformations in the economy. Neighbourhoods and skills sets can become rapidly redundant, leaving local populations economically isolated, resulting in unemployment, alienation and increased income inequalities. This trend informs a second line of investigation addressed by the texts and research in this newspaper. LSE Cities has looked at how public transport infrastructure impacts on deprived and disconnected neighbourhoods, and how investment in new mobility systems \u2013 like Rio\u2019s BRT, TransMilenio in Bogot\u00e1 and Crossrail in London \u2013 can bring people closer to their places of work. In addition to the effect of transport improvements discussed by Enrique Pe\u00f1alosa, the publication also explores how spatially targeted policies are able to concentrate investment in lower income neighbourhoods. In this regard, the Mayor of London\u2019s attention to the deprived area around Stratford and the Lower Lea Valley in East London, where the 2012 Olympics were located \u2013 the poorest districts in the capital \u2013 can be compared to Rio&#8217;s ongoing project to &#8216;urbanise&#8217; or upgrade all of the city&#8217;s <em>favelas<\/em> by 2020. To urbanise <em>favelas<\/em> means to reconnect them (socially, politically and economically) to the city so that the distinction between asphalt (city) and hill (<em>favela<\/em>), which was at the heart of the stigmatisation of residents of the latter for over thirty years, is challenged. This reconnection or opening of the <em>favelas<\/em> to the city is occurring in multiple ways. Sandra Jovchelovitch concentrates on the role that cultural groups play, acting as bridges to the outside world, and reflects on the relative porosity or openness of particular communities in Rio. S\u00e9rgio Magalh\u00e3es and Fabiana Izaga focus on the role of the State in recovering the territory of the favela from the para-state of drug traffickers, allowing some measure of normality to resume. Suketu Mehta sees their urbanisation as the replacement of para-state power with the speculative power of real estate. Rather than urbanisation programmes leading to greater equity, Mehta sees them as leading residents to the inequalities of a free economy. By eradicating one form of inequality do city transformations lead to new ones? The role of the city policymaker or planner therefore becomes more paramount, which takes us to the third critical dimension of accelerated transformations.<\/p>\n<p>Rio&#8217;s current urban renaissance, just as London&#8217;s resurgence that started over twenty years ago and Barcelona\u2019s that goes all the way back to the 1980s, share a common starting point. They are driven by a period of mass investment associated to a growing city economy. London&#8217;s recent transformation was underpinned by the globalisation of the financial services industry and Rio&#8217;s to the income from oil and gas and its indirect services economy. The role of the urban policymaker is to steer this investment into sustainable paths. The question is less about economic growth or population growth, but about how this growth rebalances the city. This rebalancing is both spatial as in London\u2019s East-to-West asymmetry and Rio\u2019s North-to-South, but also temporal. How are we to rebalance the interests of future against those of current generations?<\/p>\n<p>In this context, the need for strong planning systems that are both visionary and democratic offer a new life for \u2018big-picture planning\u2019, as Deyan Sudjic intimates. As the Urban Age considers the spatial and temporal dynamics of big planning during periods of accelerated change, it is time to reconsider the best models that deliver, as Richard Sennett argues, both <em>efficiency<\/em> and <em>sociability<\/em>.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":"","article_publishing_date":"October 2013","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"53","name":"Ricky","created":"2011-10-11 21:01:44","modified":"2014-02-04 12:29:29","slug":"burdett-ricky","family_name":"Burdett","title":"","email_address":"r.burdett@lse.ac.uk","photo_legacy":"","profile_text":"Ricky Burdett is Professor of Urban Studies and Director of LSE Cities.","organization":"LSE Cities, London School of Economics and Political Science","role":"Director","additional_affiliations":"Professor of Urban Studies, London School of Economics and Political Science Global Distinguished Professor, New York University","qualifications":"","staff_pages_blurb":"Ricky Burdett is Professor of Urban Studies, and director of LSE Cities and the Urban Age Programme.

There has been the spectacular collapse of some American iconic car firms that defined the mobile twentieth century. The city experiencing the most rapid population and economic decline in the States is Detroit, the world\u2019s \u2018car city\u2019. The global supplies of oil are running low, with one new barrel discovered for every four used. The US has recorded the first drops in car mileage for a generation or so; new cohorts of young Americans or Europeans desire the latest smartphone rather than a car. Millard-Ball and Schipper conclude from their extensive review that travel activity has reached a plateau in various western countries. Some societies have reached, or are even passing \u2018peak travel\u2019.<\/p>\n<p>And the worldwide growth of population of some billions makes it impossible for the oil-based car system to be available around the world, and especially across Asia, on even a European scale. Since around 2005 there has been a major shift in global politics towards searching for low-carbon energy and forms of transport with much experimentation seeking to move away from a high-carbon world. There are a number of very different alternative scenarios for the middle of this century, when the steel-and-petroleum car system that we have come to know and love may be no more. <\/p>\n<p>First, the effects of the politics of climate change, the peaking of oil supplies and periodic economic crises could generate local sustainability. Travel would be substantially reduced and far more local. There might be some cars around but their monopolisation of roads would have long passed. The global population would be smaller through worsening healthcare and reduced food supplies and urban centres would have fragmented. There would be a global shift towards lifestyles and forms of movement that are more local, smaller in scale and that use less energy. Friends would be chosen from neighbouring streets, families would not move away when new households are formed, work would be found nearby, education would be sought in local schools and colleges, the seasons would determine which foodstuffs were consumed, and most goods and services would be simpler and produced nearby. Global GDP would be smaller but wellbeing might be higher for those who are part of this \u2018small is beautiful\u2019 localisation of the future.<\/p>\n<p>A second alternative, a bleaker version of the first, can be termed \u2018regional warlordism\u2019. In this \u2018barbaric\u2019 future there would be oil, gas and water shortages and intermittent resource wars within the context of extreme weather events and energy shortages. There would be the breakdown of many mobility, energy and communication connections that now straddle the world. There would be a plummeting standard of living, a re-localising of movement, an increasing emphasis upon local \u2018warlords\u2019 controlling recycled forms of mobility and weaponry, and relatively weak governments. Infrastructures would collapse and there would be increasing separation between different regions. Cars and trucks, and buses and trains, would rust away in the deserts or be washed away in floods. Often regions would be at war with their neighbours, especially for control of water, oil and gas, as prefigured in <em>Mad Max 2<\/em>\u2019s portrayal of the future.<\/p>\n<p>A third alternative is \u2018hypermobility\u2019. The current patterns of mobile lives based on new communications and transportation would develop on an extreme scale. The resource shortages and effects of climate change would turn out to be less significant, at least for the rich North of the globe, partly because a magic bullet would overcome the limits of fossil fuels and provide a new mobility future. People\u2019s movement would become more extensive and frequent with novel fuels and vehicles. Personalised air travel, S\u00e3o Paulo writ large, would be common as unfashionable cars would remain stuck on the ground. A Corbusier-inspired future would beckon all to the skies, including regular flights into space with Virgin Galactic! The final frontier would indeed be overcome with a verticalisation of cities.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, there is a post-car electric future. The digital and the transportational would be integrated. Here software intelligently would work out the best means of doing tasks, whether this would involve meeting up or getting to some place or event or simply staying put. Some effects of meeting up would be effectively simulated through virtual communications that are as good as meeting face to face. \u2018Digital lives\u2019 would develop into life instead, so much so that there would be less need for travel, especially over long distances. Much business, social and family life would not be face to face. Manufacturing on demand could be enabled by 3D printing and the replacement of the long supply chains of container-based manufacturing systems.<\/p>\n<p>Personal travel would involve small, ultra-light, smart, probably battery-based vehicles that would be hired, a bit like bikes can now be hired in London, Paris or Barcelona. Streets would be full of often speed-controlled micro cars, demand-responsive minibuses, bikes, electric bikes, hybrid vehicles, driverless rapid transit systems and pedestrians. Ideally these would be seamlessly integrated with larger-scale public transport. Smartphones, or their successors, would control access and payment for multiple and interconnected forms of mobility. Neighbourhoods would be reengineered to constrain sprawl. Carbon allowances would be allocated, monitored and individually measured through new apps. There would be less freedom to walk, drive or move without traces being left and some payment extracted. Such a digital system would be like an Orwellian airport city and would need to be subject to energetic democratic control.<\/p>\n<p>So there are four futures, and all have their costs, dangers and injustices. None is simply preferable, none is the most likely to develop, and all may be contested. And the best is not necessarily the one which will develop. How might the last of these be realised?<\/p>\n<p>Certainly the combination of high oil prices, extreme weather events, and stagnating economic growth indicate some green shoots of a powering down of fast oil-based travel within parts of the rich North. The beginning of this century is like the beginning of the last one, when the car system was being assembled out of many inventions, discoveries, tinkerings, and new marketing. Something similar is taking place today, and a whole new socio-technical system may emerge out of very disparate elements, of technologies, materials, policies, payment systems and social practices that are like islands of an archipelago that may turn out to be components of a new system.<\/p>\n<p>Central here would be some shift from an ownership to an access economy, as Jeremy Rifkin has long advocated. It is also something much trialled with car clubs and new car-hire schemes. Car manufacturers are experimenting with pay-as-you-go schemes for electric vehicles (EVs). Daimler, Peugeot and others expect these to attract younger customers familiar with access payments for Internet services. Better Place will charge by the mile; indeed if the EV is highly subsidised or even free (and then effectively recycled) payments would just be by distance. Central would be so-called \u2018near-field communications\u2019 to enable the supply of interchangeable mobility services to be accessed, paid for, but not predominantly owned.<\/p>\n<p>By the middle of this century a post-car system could emerge unexpectedly, off-centre, not from a current home of the car. Examples here could be electric bike innovation in China, a Better Place EV battery replacement system in Israel, public transport integrated systems in Brazil, the Bay Area becoming the EV capital of the US, Chinese officials making China the world&#8217;s largest producer of EVs and setting up recharging throughout Wuhan, and so on. <\/p>\n<p>But there are formidable technological, economic, organisational and social problems in engineering this system to push the steel-and-petroleum car system aside. It is necessary that EVs, whether with four, three or two wheels, come to be a socio-technical system that over time makes the steel-and-petroleum system obsolete, instead of merely providing extra vehicles for eco-prestige seekers. Also significant here would be the prevention of the rebound effect, of fun and fashionable EVs being so well used that extra mileage occurs. And this says nothing about how the electricity is itself generated, although EVs are up to four times as efficient as petrol-driven vehicles, although the use of coal as the most common fuel for generating electricity is a major concern here.<\/p>\n<p>During the twentieth century it seemed that oil-based mobile lives would spread to all continents and most peoples, albeit with huge inequalities. That century operated as though there was a free lunch to be enjoyed at the expense of the next century, with half the world\u2019s oil being burnt and in a way that resulted in changing global climates. Now we are in that century we find that futures are not at all rosy, that the car and its high-carbon friends have left little standing in their wake. <\/p>\n<p>By the end of this century the steel-and-petroleum car system that we have come to know and love will be no more. If there will be cars, they will be mainly housed in museums, if museums still exist. Cars, one- to two-ton monsters powered by refined oil, built of steel, privately owned, seating at least four people, and with their own territory called roads and car parks, will be seen as dinosaurs, remnants of the twentieth century. People may gawp at them a little, like 1950s American cars are now gawped at by tourists on the streets of Havana. Cars will be so last century! The car system will not be around by the end of this century, but none of the alternatives are without major costs and risks. Much indeed is up for grabs.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":"","article_publishing_date":"December 2012","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"291","name":"John","created":"2012-11-27 19:54:52","modified":"2012-11-27 19:54:52","slug":"urry-john","family_name":"Urry","title":"","email_address":"","photo_legacy":"","profile_text":"","organization":"","role":"","additional_affiliations":"","qualifications":"","staff_pages_blurb":"","office_location":"","display_after":"","display_until":"","extended_blurb":"","special_2012ec_blurb":"<p>John Urry is Distinguished Professor of Sociology at Lancaster University.

Politicians are beholden to business-as-usual and short-term political imperatives, while the schools of architecture and urban planning develop studio projects on sites and problems for mere educational purposes rather than as proposals for actual alternatives to the city\u2019s development. Practising architects also rarely respond proactively to Istanbul\u2019s problems because of the profession\u2019s unforgiving culture of survival. The few civic actors operating in the built environment are likewise too disorganised and lack either the management capacities or financial strength. Given this situation, one could come to the conclusion that the municipalities and mayors of Istanbul have not had any proactive support or contributions for years.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, when Urban Age initiated a spatial study of Istanbul with the Arkitera Architecture Center, it was an opportunity not to be missed. Five young architectural teams were selected to propose solutions to the problems they detected as urgent issues for Istanbul. Free to choose the areas they would work on, it was each team\u2019s responsibility to also define the problem they would develop an answer for. Thus three months of research resulted in five different proposals for five different areas and issues in Istanbul. They vary in scale and content, and although none of the proposed solutions are ready to be implemented, each of them demonstrates how a solution to neglected problems in Istanbul could be initiated.<\/p>\n<p>Hopefully it is not too na\u00efve to believe these proposals, or similar studies, could be utilised in the real-life management of the city. In the meantime, since decision-makers in our cities really do need clever solutions instead of harsh reactions, as professionals we should be prepared to collaborate rather than resist.<\/p>\n<p><strong>So?: Nature Next to the City<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_749\" style=\"width: 380px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-749\" title=\"01_SOArchitecture\" src=\"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/11\/01_SOArchitecture.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"370\" height=\"296\" \/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Reframing the border between urban dwellings and the forest as a public space with nodes for public institutions allows a reconsideration of the value of urban forests.<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Istanbul&#8217;s northern forests, home to the city&#8217;s fresh-water reservoirs, also provide fresh air to the city. These natural resources have been threatened by the encroachment of illegal settlements since the 1950s, and the bridges across the Bosporus that connect the two sides of Istanbul. Now, the announcement of a third bridge has reignited the debate about the preservation of these forests. Despite strict regulations to preserve areas surrounding water reservoirs and the forests all over Turkey, especially in large cities, these laws are rarely enforced. On the other hand the emergence of &#8216;green&#8217; terminology has almost transformed these urban forests, which until recently were either perceived as just green stains on a map for professionals or as mere spectacle for the public, into intangible assets.<\/p>\n<p>SO Architecture focused on the Sultanbeyli area, a newly developed settlement on the edge of the northern forest of Istanbul. Their research asked an important question: how do you keep the forests free from illegal buildings? Without enhancing awareness of the public value of forests, laws alone cannot protect the green areas of the city. According to SO Architecture&#8217;s proposal, the boundary between nature and the urbanised city should be utilised as public spaces. If they have the right to use this public corridor, the people living next to the forests are more likely to preserve the green areas.<\/p>\n<p>In the plan, the corridor between the settlements and the forests will have nodes with public facilities such as libraries, cultural buildings, community centres, health clinics, schools, religious buildings or kindergartents. These nodes will sometimes be located within the urban tissue, thus carrying part of the forests into the builg environment, but sometimes the nodes will be inserted slightly into the forests, carrying the urban tissue into the green land. It is expected this will alter the boundary with the forest into a more integrated spatial field, connecting nature with the urban tissue like a zipper.<\/p>\n<p><strong>PAB Architecture: The Neglected Sister<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_750\" style=\"width: 380px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-750\" title=\"02_PABArchitecture\" src=\"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/11\/02_PABArchitecture.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"370\" height=\"255\" \/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Clusters of buildings reconnect the waterfront to the city suffocated by roads.<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Halic, or the Golden Horn, became the neglected sister of the Bosporus after becoming an industrial area in the beginning of the nineteenth century. Substantial efforts to clean up this brown field area replaced almost all of the industrial buildings with parks in the 1980s. However, this rapid rehabilitation eradicated many valuable industrial heritage sites and the newly constructed green parks were not planned adequately enough to attract local residents. By 2000, the area around the Golden Horn started to become an attractive tourist destination, although currently there is no masterplan to coordinate development.<\/p>\n<p>According to PAB Architecture, the uncontrolled developments on the banks of the Golden Horn will eventually break the connections within the existing residential tissue. Without a masterplan many facilities are being constructed without any relation between them. If this process is not stopped, the future of the Golden Horn may again be as it was a hundred years ago, but this time not as an industrial brown field but a deserted spoiled graveyard of tourist facilities. Therefore PAB propose to extend a portion of the urban tissue into the empty green fields on the banks of the Golden Horn. These new clusters are intended to release the pressure on the existing urban tissue and to adjust the balance of empty green parks by creating multi-use structures that include housing, small offices and commercial facilities. These building clusters will also act as visual and physical bridges to the residential areas behind the road along the coast.<\/p>\n<p><strong>8Arti: Reclaiming the Valleys<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_751\" style=\"width: 380px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-751\" title=\"03_8Arti\" src=\"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/11\/03_8Arti.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"370\" height=\"357\" \/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Implementing a 40-metre principle recognises the unique topography of the city, opening up the valleys and waterways.<\/p><\/div>\n<p>8Arti examined two defining, intertwined features of Istanbul: its skyline and its valleys. The magnificent skyline of Istanbul&#8217;s historic peninsula is a result of the clever utilisation of its topography. In 1936, a proposal to preserve this skyline stipulated that 40 metres above sea level, no new buildings should exceed 9.5 metres in height. This principle is still in force today, and has ensured the preservation of the historic peninsula until now. However, the city&#8217;s rapid urbanisation has led to new settlements reaching the edge of the northern forests, which has almost hidden this topography with a homogeneous blanket that neglects the city\u2019s dominant and unique geographic features and differences.<\/p>\n<p>The valleys act as ecological corridors that regulate air circulation within the city while they also collect and direct rainwater to the coast. However, until now those valleys have been considered as barriers for urbanisation: their riverbeds are covered and their banks are filled with, sometimes illegal, apartment blocks with insufficient infrastructure and social facilities.<\/p>\n<p>8Arti chose a small valley reaching from the Levent business district to the Kagithane area as its project site. In applying an alternative 40-metre principle, 8Arti proposes to clear all buildings between sea level and 40 metres above the valley basin and to transform the valley basin into a green public space. After this reclamation, the displaced population will be re-housed in the buildings to be erected above the 40-metre line above the valley basin. However, these new building settlements will be designed to accommodate an equal population and more social infrastructure with a more efficient planning code and a \u2018super-social\u2019 building for libraries, religious buildings, health and educational facilities.<\/p>\n<p><strong>GB Architecture: Revisiting the Perimeter Block<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_752\" style=\"width: 380px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-752\" title=\"04_GBArchitecture\" src=\"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/11\/04_GBArchitecture.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"370\" height=\"260\" \/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">With the same density as the isolated tower block, the perimeter block defines shared communal spaces.<\/p><\/div>\n<p>By the 1950s uncontrolled immigration to Istanbul had started to cause rapid urbanisation of the city. As a result, the free-standing multi-storey apartment building became the model people believed would solve the housing problems for Istanbul\u2019s citizens. This building type proliferated across the city, neglecting geographical, social, economical or even ecological differences. Urban forms and building codes were all adapted to regulate the spread of this type, which in turn created a dull urban pattern. The current activities of the housing development authority of Turkey (TOKI: Toplu Konut \u0130daresi) also boost the proliferation of these independent generic tower apartment blocks, which are now being built on the periphery of Istanbul.<\/p>\n<p>GB Architecture proposed to reinvent the perimeter block as a new urban form for Istanbul. Choosing a large area near Kucukcekmece, they argued that the current urban planning codes that encourage the building of independent tower blocks, are inappropriate for the city since they do not create enough public and semi-public spaces. Therefore, they developed a new masterplanning guide by first designing the areas within the perimeter blocks to allow alternative uses, multiple functions and varying floor plans. The resulting blocks create different forms of courtyards, with horizontal or vertical slabs that integrate with each other to act as a coherently working machine, as well as a defined urban space. This study also seeks to address the masterplanning of certain sites in Istanbul; GB believes special studies rather than an application of predetermined building codes should prevail to allow the diversity of the urban tissue to accommodate the diversity of the city.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Superpool: the Other Half of Istanbul<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_753\" style=\"width: 380px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-753\" title=\"05_SuperpoolArchitecture\" src=\"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/11\/05_SuperpoolArchitecture.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"370\" height=\"387\" \/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Relocating parking allows streets use to adapt to people rather than cars, and recognises the street as the most important public space in Istanbul.<\/p><\/div>\n<p>How do you plan a parking strategy in a city that has more than 2.5 million private cars, with a daily increase of 400? Currently Istanbul can accommodate only 250,000 or so parked vehicles, mostly at sites maintained by the municipality&#8217;s parking company. And while new building regulations demand parking spaces to be reserved in the planning phase, the old settlements do not have adequate car parking facilities. Given this situation, one can assume that most of the streets and open urban spaces are occupied as car parks, which comes close to the total land area occupied by buildings in Istanbul.<\/p>\n<p>Superpool Architecture decided to focus on the use of streets as public spaces. Istanbul is well known for the lack of planned and designed open spaces for the public. Given this situation one might expect that Istanbul\u2019s open areas lack public life. However, Superpool chose two different sites to illustrate the opposite: one within the historic peninsula in Karagumruk on the European side, and another on the Anatolian side in a relatively recent settlement called Namik Kemal. The latter has a more regular street pattern compared to the organic pattern of Karagumruk. In Istanbul, public life is very vivid on the streets and defies any predictions or plans. The improvised public use of the streets is a key factor to consider while designing for Istanbul. However, most of the streets are largely occupied by parked cars which leaves little space for pedestrians or neighbourhood residents.<\/p>\n<p>Superpool proposed to build parking structures within two minutes\u2019 walking distances in the two earmarked neighbourhoods and they proposed to use some of the streets as pedestrian areas or public spaces with restricted access by car. Some of the secondary streets will be turned into public parks with drop-off zones for cars, while some will function as playgrounds for children. Some may even be used as small-scale organic agricultural sites for the residents. This relocation of the cars and reclaiming of parking spaces will require a minimal intervention but will create the maximum amount of open air spaces that can be used by residents. The newly developed parking structures will require their own management plans and also include some commercial and social facilities for the community. The management plans of these parking structures will need to be developed in such a way that they allow long-term economic sustainability.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":"http:\/\/v0.urban-age.net\/publications\/newspapers\/istanbul\/articles\/arkiteraSpatialStudy\/en_GB\/ArkiteraSpatialStudy_en.pdf","article_publishing_date":"November 2009","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"26","name":"\u00d6mer","created":"2011-10-04 13:41:15","modified":"2011-10-04 14:41:15","slug":null,"family_name":"Kan\u0131pak","title":null,"email_address":null,"photo_legacy":null,"profile_text":"","organization":"","role":"","additional_affiliations":null,"qualifications":null,"staff_pages_blurb":null,"office_location":null,"display_after":null,"display_until":null,"extended_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb_lang2":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation_lang2":null,"phone_number":null}],"attachments":false,"gallery":{"slug":false,"extra_classes":"","slides":[]}},{"request_language":"","current_page_uri":"\/media\/search-dev.json","lang2_slug":false,"lang2_name":false,"parent_publication_id":7,"featured_image_uri":"","article_title":"Berlin: A Profile","permalink":"berlin-a-profile","article_subtitle":"","article_abstract":"","article_summary":"","article_text":"","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":"http:\/\/v0.urban-age.net\/0_downloads\/Berlin_Jens_Bisky_2006-Berlin_A_Profile.pdf","article_publishing_date":"November 2006","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"54","name":"Jens","created":"2011-10-11 21:03:21","modified":"2011-10-11 22:03:21","slug":null,"family_name":"Bisky","title":null,"email_address":null,"photo_legacy":null,"profile_text":"","organization":"","role":"","additional_affiliations":null,"qualifications":null,"staff_pages_blurb":null,"office_location":null,"display_after":null,"display_until":null,"extended_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb_lang2":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation_lang2":null,"phone_number":null}],"attachments":false,"gallery":{"slug":false,"extra_classes":"","slides":[]}},{"request_language":"","current_page_uri":"\/media\/search-dev.json","lang2_slug":false,"lang2_name":false,"parent_publication_id":19,"featured_image_uri":"","article_title":"Building Healthy Cities","permalink":"building-healthy-cities","article_subtitle":"The Experience and Challenges Faced by China","article_abstract":"","article_summary":"","article_text":"<p align=\"left\">Cities are crucial for China\u2019s economic development.

Public health campaigns (PHCs) originated in the 1950s during the Korean War as a means to fight the threat of chemical and biological warfare, and were later institutionalised as a civilian affair and continued regularly until 1966, playing an important role in disease control and health education. They were suspended during the Cultural Revolution, but resumed in 1978 before being transformed into award schemes that encouraged cities to reach certain public hygiene standards in 1989, under the so-called Hygienic City Campaign (HCC).<\/p>\n<p align=\"left\">Cities wishing to become a National Hygienic City have to go through a series of campaigns in order to climb up the ladder, step-by-step. The campaigns focus on health education, city appearance, environmental sanitation, public hygiene, the cleanliness of drinking water, food hygiene and infectious disease control, among others. Taken together, there are more than 60 indicators to measure and hundreds of targets to meet. Although central government sets the indicators and targets, local governments do not have to follow a prescribed campaign model. Some cities in the less developed western provinces face less pressure from industrialisation and migration and end up spending more on upgrading public toilets, setting up modern sewers and improving the provision of drinking water, than on improving air quality. Cities have to go through several stages from the local level to the top to become a national level winner, as do districts and rural townships participating in the &#8216;hygienic district\/township&#8217; campaigns.<\/p>\n<p align=\"left\">The key motivation for participating is that officials in winning cities have a good chance of being promoted. Outstanding individual performers may be honoured and even rewarded financially. Participating cities also receive special grants from higher government authorities. It is, therefore, not difficult for organisers to attract willing participants. By the end of 2009, 118 National Hygienic Cities, 28 National Hygienic Urban Neighbourhoods and 377 National Hygienic Counties and Towns had been awarded.<\/p>\n<p align=\"left\">The HCC helps to transform a city in many ways. It motivates a greater investment in basic services and public infrastructure than local governments would otherwise be likely to make and increases public awareness of hygiene issues. In order to win, city authorities need to choreograph wide-ranging support from lower level officials, public and private enterprises and the general public. As a result, a large part of the campaign is about educating the public and getting them involved. If run well, a campaign\u2019s knock-on effect can be engendering the public to demand better services from the local government in the future. The competitive nature of the campaigns helps to keep local officials accountable and dramatically increases their responsiveness while the campaign is in progress.<\/p>\n<p align=\"left\">Sustaining the benefits can, however, be a major challenge and the structure of the competition helps in this regard. First, it takes many years to become a national level winner: it took Guanghzou 18 years to finally be awarded the title, Xining ten years, Nanjing 14 years and Yichang 12 years. Second, some of the indicators in the competition concern institutional or governmental changes that are hard to reverse. Third, the National Committee checks a sample of the past winners every three years and cities failing to meet the standards are given a warning or stripped of their title. Finally, new competitions have also been set up, such as the Civilised City Campaign, providing new city-wide challenges to winners of the hygienic city competitions.<\/p>\n<p align=\"left\">In spite of these benefits, and the mechanisms put in place to sustain efforts, the HCC is controversial. A single-minded focus on winning awards can disrupt regular services and have negative impacts upon local businesses. In some cities, such as Kunming and Guangzhou, for example, government officials were required to commit to deliver certain results. Failing to deliver meant they would lose their jobs. This method enhanced the responsiveness of officials but it also meant that they became ruthless in the face of obstacles. In Kunming, for example, officials demanded that all small businesses remove anti-theft protection to make the markets look nicer but no compensating efforts were made to improve safety. The ensuing tension between the public and policy-enforcers culminated in a riot in 2009. In a bid to reduce litter and waste accumulating in public spaces, businesses in Xining and Lanzhou were required to decrease opening hours to align with the guidelines set by policy-enforcers.<\/p>\n<p align=\"left\">In addition to receiving grants from higher government authorities, cities also try to raise funds from district governments. Sometimes, businesses, public sector organisations and individuals have been coerced to contribute, through direct financial contribution as well as through providing materials and committing their own time. In order to increase accessibility to public toilets and drinking water, for example, state enterprises in Xining were required to open their facilities to the public and school terms were cut short in order to secure student volunteers for the effort.<\/p>\n<p align=\"left\">As a secondary source of revenue increase, some local governments focused on urban regeneration to improve the city\u2019s appearance. Xining and Kunming wanted to attract more tourists and cities in the Jiangsu province wanted to attract more investment. These efforts create situations where cities might plant grass to quickly increase their green areas, without thinking about the impact on increased water consumption.<\/p>\n<p align=\"left\">Above all, the top-down approach of the HCC tends to invite cheating. Some local governments resort to fraudulent measures in order to make a good impression on inspectors. During their inspection period the city of Jiaozuo in Henan Province temporarily turned many unhygienic restaurants into bookshops or tourist agencies in order to avoid inspection. In another example, some small restaurants in Xining did not open their toilets to customers so that they would remain spotlessly clean, while others stopped offering tissues to customers in order to prevent littering.<\/p>\n<p align=\"left\">Given the drawbacks of the HCC, should it be stopped altogether? There are several reasons why a hygiene campaign of some sort should continue to exist. First, the HCC does lead to increased public awareness, which may make the possibility of the public demanding a better environment and improved hygiene in the future more likely. During campaigns, people use Internet forums to expose the fraudulent practices of the local governments, as well as to show their appreciation of improved cleanliness and new facilities. They were also more outspoken and dissatisfied when standards dropped again after the campaigns. Second, concerns about sustainability may be of second order in comparison to taking action in the first place. Indicators and management style can then be improved in order to avoid creating perverse incentives. However, whether people can rely on government officials to make such improvements themselves is questionable.<\/p>\n<p align=\"left\">It is, however, important to point out that cleanliness is only relevant to some of the health problems faced by China\u2019s urban residents. In 2009, a health survey was carried out in 589 cities with nearly one million interviewees. The average age of people suffering from high blood pressure, high cholesterol and high blood sugar was found to have dropped from over 50 to just 30 to 40 years. Such results are not just a problem of unaffordable health care, but also reflect dramatic changes in lifestyle. Unhealthy eating habits, long and stressful work, irregular sleeping patterns, over-indulgence in Internet surfing and frequent business banquets, are all possible contributors to urban health problems. The survey shows that the richer a city becomes, the poorer the health profile of the population gets, with Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen faring worse than less prosperous cities.<\/p>\n<p align=\"left\">Influenced by the World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO) ideas about healthy cities, some second-tier Chinese cities, such as Suzhou and Hangzhou, have made an early start in exploring a broader conception of healthy and liveable cities. In 2007, the Ministry of Health set up a task-force dedicated to promoting a healthy lifestyle throughout China and a number of cities and urban districts were selected as pilots for \u2018Healthy City\u2019 schemes.<\/p>\n<p align=\"left\">As the country becomes increasingly urbanised, health challenges increase. Rapid growth of urban population and unaffordable housing, in particular in megacities, generates poor and overcrowded housing conditions in suburban slums and urban villages. These neighbourhoods do not always receive equal basic services and suffer from poor infrastructure. According to the WHO, the proportion of China\u2019s urban population using shared sanitation has grown from 25 to 30 per cent between 1990 and 2008, while the proportion defecating in the open has risen from 3 to 6 per cent. Such residents are more likely to be affected by infectious diseases, posing major threats to cities.<\/p>\n<p align=\"left\">Changes in lifestyle and environment mean that a broader range of health issues, formerly considered private, are entering the public domain. People are more aware of the problems associated with these issues and are demanding improved services. For example, the need to deal with stress, depression and other mental health problems, especially suicides resulting from poor working conditions and long working hours, has received more attention. Public media has also brought several issues into the spotlight, including infectious disease outbreaks, notably SARS, and various food security cases. Changes in public perception put greater pressure on policy-makers to respond, demanding more profound changes in the planning and governance of cities.<\/p>\n<p align=\"left\">These public aspects have much do to with how urban environments are designed and constructed, how urban businesses are operated and how urban people lead their life. In spite of China\u2019s dedicated hygiene campaigns, according to the WHO it has the world\u2019s highest rate of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease due to the country\u2019s serious environmental pollution. Urban public health campaigns therefore must be about much more than making the city look more attractive. Rather, there needs to be greater determination and concerted effort to tackle the major sources of environmental problems.<\/p>\n<p align=\"left\"><strong><em><br \/><\/em><\/strong><em><\/em><\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/11\/2011_chw_5030_Li.pdf","article_publishing_date":"November 2011","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"123","name":"Bingqin","created":"2011-11-04 11:36:19","modified":"2011-11-04 11:36:19","slug":null,"family_name":"Li","title":null,"email_address":null,"photo_legacy":null,"profile_text":null,"organization":null,"role":null,"additional_affiliations":null,"qualifications":null,"staff_pages_blurb":null,"office_location":null,"display_after":null,"display_until":null,"extended_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb_lang2":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation_lang2":null,"phone_number":null}],"attachments":false,"gallery":{"slug":false,"extra_classes":"","slides":[]}},{"request_language":"","current_page_uri":"\/media\/search-dev.json","lang2_slug":"pt-br","lang2_name":"Portuguese (Brasil)","parent_publication_id":1,"featured_image_uri":"","article_title":"Building Urban Assets in South America","permalink":"building-urban-assets-in-south-america","article_subtitle":"","article_abstract":"<p>In an in-depth overview of the various forms of regional governance across South America, Jeroen Klink analyses the institutional capacity of metropolitan areas to influence and restructure the urban economy.<\/p>\n","article_summary":"","article_text":"<p><div id=\"attachment_40\" style=\"width: 406px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/08\/03_SA08Ref_Klink.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-40\" title=\"Downtown Buenos Aires\" src=\"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/08\/03_SA08Ref_Klink.jpg\" alt=\"Downtown Buenos Aires\" width=\"396\" height=\"274\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">A new waste management plan is expected to help keep the streets of downtown Buenos Aires clean. Uncoordinated and fragmented policies for services - with the excption of solid waste management - across the metropolitan area are largely to blame for Greater Buenos Aires\u2019 environmental degradation.<\/p><\/div>\n<p>The development trajectory of the South American continent in the 1980s has commonly been interpreted by macro-economists in terms of \u2018the lost decade\u2019, specifically in light of the debt crisis and the subsequent cumbersome structural adjustment programmes. Nevertheless, it can be claimed that the region suffered a second, perhaps less visible setback in the 1990s, from which it has been trying to recover only recently. More specifically, while many South American countries witnessed an intense socio-economic, technological and regulatory adjustment process, with often dramatic impacts on cities and metropolitan areas, there was a surprising lack of a solid and transparent institutional and legal framework that could guide transformations in South American city-regions and metropolitan areas in a sustainable manner. The institutional vacuum in metropolitan areas was all the more dramatic considering the continent\u2019s relatively urbanised profile, in which large city regions had often been the spatial nodes of earlier national import substitutions strategies, and where, to some extent, challenges at the national and the metropolitan or regional scale \u2013 social exclusion, environmental degradation and overall loss in competitiveness \u2013 had become increasingly interdependent. Moreover, as has been analysed extensively by South American scholars of urban development, the continent\u2019s cities and city regions were entering this new stage of the internationalisation process when historical deficits, both in terms of access to basic services, land and sustainable and predictable sources of finance, had, to say the least, not been settled satisfactorily; as a matter of fact, there was suspicion that in many South American metropolitan areas disparities had actually been growing during a large part of the 1990s.<\/p>\n<p>A few examples to illustrate the point. Greater Santiago generates about half of Chile\u2019s GDP, while approximately two thirds of the country\u2019s population is concentrated in the city regions of Santiago, Valparaiso and Concepc\u00edon. Although the Chilean development model has generally been recognised for its achievements in terms of growth with poverty reduction, Santiago has increasingly been facing rapid sprawl, reduction of environmental quality, socio-spatial segregation and escalating intra-metropolitan disparities. Recent theoretical work on the spatial evolution of Greater Santiago has confirmed a (postmodern) pattern of fragmented land uses, privatisation of public spaces and social-spatial segregation, as reflected in the proliferation of gated (vertical and horizontal) communities, often directly connected to specific workplaces by (frequently privately financed) motorways, the rise of completely new towns and isolated industrial, commercial and technological parks and districts. At the same time, this patchwork of cities is situated in an institutional limbo, particularly considering the fact that Chile doesn\u2019t have specific arrangements for metropolitan areas and agglomerations. This is all the more worrying particularly for Santiago, where governance is fragmented over three provinces (one being Santiago itself, which is in turn subdivided into 32 municipalities).<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_41\" style=\"width: 406px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/08\/03_SA08Ref_Klink2.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-41\" title=\"New concrete and brick houses in Rocinha, the largest favela in Brazil located on the hillside of Rio de Janeiro\" src=\"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/08\/03_SA08Ref_Klink2.jpg\" alt=\"New concrete and brick houses in Rocinha, the largest favela in Brazil located on the hillside of Rio de Janeiro\" width=\"396\" height=\"274\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Development of new concrete and brick houses in Rocinha, the largest favela in Brazil located on the hillside of Rio de Janeiro, is largely driven by auto-construction. Even so, basic sanitation and infrastructure is better here than most favelas across the country due to systematic community intervention.<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Along the same lines, the agglomeration of Greater Buenos Aires, although not existing as a formal political and administrative body as such, but nevertheless loosely defined as the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires and the surrounding 32 cities, concentrates approximately half of the production and a third of the population of the country. In the 1990s, the city region was the central stage of a traumatic process of productive restructuring and de-industrialisation. The absence of clear metropolitan governance structures, reflected in a complex and overlapping set of responsibilities allocated between a strong province, the federated Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, peripheral local governments and the institutions of the national government, made it all the more difficult to develop effective strategies to deal with the rapidly growing intra-metropolitan disparities and a pattern of environmental degradation. It was not that surprising, therefore, that during the 1990s Greater Buenos Aires witnessed a proliferation of suburban gated communities and metropolitan sprawl.<\/p>\n<p>According to 2003 data, Greater Bogot\u00e1, roughly composed of the central city (7 million inhabitants) and 24 surrounding municipalities (giving a total population of about 8.2 million), concentrated approximately 30 per cent of the national GDP (and 40 per cent of national industrial GDP), and about one fifth of the national population. The opening up of the Colombian trading regime reinforced the region\u2019s attractiveness and its role as the main national economic powerhouse. By the year 2010, the city-region is expected to grow to 9.6 million inhabitants. In the last few years, the traditional polarised relationship between the central city of Bogot\u00e1 and its surrounding municipalities has given way to a gradual process of regionalisation of production and land uses. Thus, several surrounding municipalities have been growing much faster than Bogot\u00e1 itself; the lack of physical space, and the relatively higher land prices have also induced industries to increasingly locate themselves directly outside the central city, attracting subsequent additional investments in the tertiary sector and in complementary infrastructure to such areas as Sabana. This process has only increased the stakes to develop adequate arrangements to deal with the many challenges the region faces: socio-spatial exclusion (some 40 per cent of metropolitan income of Greater Bogot\u00e1 is concentrated in the hands of the upper 7 per cent), the rapid increase in Bogot\u00e1 river\u2019s pollution levels, the inter-municipal transportation of freight and people as well as land use planning in environmentally sensitive areas. The Regional Roundtable of the Bogot\u00e1-Cundinamarca region, launched in 2001 and involving the national government, the state government of Cundinamarca, the city of Bogot\u00e1 itself as well as 116 surrounding municipal administrations and three environmental special purpose districts, was an innovative approach, aimed at creating an informal multi-stakeholder policy so as to bring together a fragmented metropolitan system. However, recent evaluations by the United Nations Center for Regional Development, which has been supporting this process since the beginning, have stressed the need to strengthen these mechanisms with more formal arrangements.<\/p>\n<p>The Brazilian scenario of the 1990s was no exception to this overall pattern of intense national socio-economic restructuring coupled with the lack of an institutional, financial and managerial framework to collectively work on a strategic agenda for metropolitan areas. An agenda like that would have established key priorities in order to both capture the potential economies of agglomeration on the one hand, and to reduce the historical social deficits in metropolitan areas on the other hand. Like in other countries in the region, this agenda didn\u2019t emerge in Brazil. The metropolitan scale may have been associated with the military regime, which indeed allocated resources on the basis of an authoritarian metropolitan logic, and this may explain why the issue of city regional governance was practically neglected by the national constitutional assembly of 1988, heavily influenced as it was by new stakeholders such as the mayors and the social movements. These actors pushed for an agenda in terms of decentralisation and democratisation, which, by and large, neglected the issue of inter-municipal and inter-sector territorial coordination.<\/p>\n<p>Thus, during the 1990s, Brazil\u2019s industrial heartland of S\u00e3o Paulo, and specifically the so-called ABC region (sometimes labelled the Brazilian Detroit), which concentrated the bulk of the country\u2019s car industry and a substantial part of its petrochemical complex, had to face the negative consequences of the changing Brazilian macro-economic regime without any consolidated framework for metropolitan governance. While the national government emphasised a strategy of deregulation and retreat from active industrial and technological policies, the restructuring of big industry in the region caused high unemployment and underemployment, increasing poverty rates and social-spatial exclusion. Real estate speculation and lack of local government control over land markets also triggered a proliferation of slums and irregular settlements in the outskirts of the S\u00e3o Paulo Metropolitan Region, frequently in environmentally sensitive and watershed protected areas. Being a highly politicised region that had participated actively in the process of Brazilian re-democratisation, and counting with proactive segments such as the labour unions and the social movements, an innovative response was organised by local stakeholders, which collectively created and negotiated the elaboration of an inter-municipal consortium, a Regional Chamber for Participatory Strategic Planning and an Economic Development Agency. In spite of the innovative character and the entrepreneurial drive behind some of these initiatives, it should not distract attention from the fact that, at least until recently, the low financial capacity, the weak institutional recognition within Brazilian fiscal federalism and the high dependence on individual leadership (particularly late Mayor Celso Daniel from the city of Santo Andr\u00e9, and leaders from the labour unions and industry), proved to be bottlenecks in increasing the scale and continuity of this informal system of regional governance, and replicating it in other metropolitan areas.<\/p>\n<p>The institutional and political vacuum that surrounds metropolitan regions has even affected cities that were considered to be model cases of good urban governance and urban planning in the South American context. For example, the city of Curitiba has been widely benchmarked as a sustainable and well-planned city, specifically so in its capacity to guide city growth through financially accessible and good quality public transportation linked to land use planning. Recent developments have shown that this picture does not quite match the reality of Greater Curitiba. Along the same lines as other South American experiences, the process of metropolisation, which is reflected in an increasingly dense pattern of functional interdependencies between the central city and its outskirts, has revealed the deficiencies of the Curitiba model in a painfully clear manner. For instance, while development in the eastern zone was proscribed in the 1978 metropolitan master plan and its recent update, since that area concentrates the environmentally sensitive areas and the watersheds, and provides approximately 70 per cent of the urban water supply, this was exactly where urban growth occurred. Part of this distorted land use pattern could be explained by the aggressive subsidies and tax incentives that had been given to attract industries away from the more expensive locations in Brazil (particularly the State of S\u00e3o Paulo). At the same time, Curitiba\u2019s highly acclaimed integrated public transportation system has not been able to cope with the rapid growth in inter-municipal journeys between the central city and the metropolitan outskirts. Since the late 1990s, congestion and private car ownership have grown exponentially.<\/p>\n<p>It should be acknowledged that governments in South America have increasingly become aware of this interdependence between what happens in their metropolitan areas and national welfare. The Brazilian government, for example, created a new framework law on inter-municipal consortia to strengthen the institutional and organisational capacity of these bodies and allow their transformation from rather loose planning institutions into bodies that are also capable of effectively implementing city, regional and metropolitan functions, such as transport, watershed planning and management, solid waste disposal and economic development, among others. Nevertheless, laws by themselves are no substitute for political leadership; a remarkably small number of inter-municipal consortia has been created since the promulgation of the law, probably also in light of a \u2018zero sum mentality\u2019 of some of the local leadership. This lack of a strategic view could well represent a concrete bottleneck in terms of moving towards a scenario in which local governments voluntarily plan, finance and implement services of common interest, either with state and national support or not. Ironically, the ABC region\u2019s inter-municipal consortium mentioned above, which proved both to be one of the more innovating initiatives in the 1990s in terms of city regional governance and which had also lobbied successfully for the new federal legislation on public consortia, has to date not adapted its legal and organisational structure in order to make use of the potential offered by the law.<\/p>\n<p>As mentioned earlier, social movements and non-governmental organisations, although not always holding a metropolitan perspective, did succeed in pressing for improvements in the transparency and effectiveness of governance systems in South American city-regions. In this respect, the Brazilian innovative and progressive legislation on the so-called \u2018Statute of the City\u2019 is a paradigmatic example; its elaboration and approval in 2001 can be considered a direct result of more than a decade of political mobilisation by housing movements, planners, intellectuals and professional associations, focused on improving urban land markets. The legislation has allowed for the implementation of municipal masterplans that incorporate a series of instruments \u2013 special low-income zoning, development exactions, progressive land taxes on vacant land, etc. \u2013 which, at least in theory, increase the leverage of local governments over the functioning of urban land markets. Nevertheless, the instrument has yet to provide a concrete solution to the dilemma of uncoordinated and fragmented land uses at the metropolitan level. As a matter of fact, the law has no built-in mechanism for the coordination of individual municipal masterplans; thus, in practice, the bulk of Brazilian metropolitan land markets is guided by a patchwork of masterplans that have been elaborated on the basis of different criteria and methodologies, without incorporating a more strategic view on the sustainable development of the metropolitan areas as such.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps this is one of the key lessons that emerges from the intense process of urban and economic restructuring in the last two decades or so in these city-regions: although occasional successes have improved the governance of these areas, involving both public sector innovation, decentralisation and mobilisation of non-governmental stakeholders, the challenges to systematically reduce socio-spatial exclusion, organise fragmented and speculative land use markets, confront environmental degradation, intra-metropolitan disparities and loss of economic competitiveness remain impressive. In effect, it seems that the decentralisations and democratisations of the 1990s were only the first steps in what can be considered to be a collective learning process that has only just started. In that sense, both the fragmented pattern of functional regionalism in Greater Buenos Aires, the intense conflicts between the central city of Curitiba and its peripheral towns regarding the management, finance and organisation of particular services, the Regional Roundtable of Bogot\u00e1-Cundinamarca and, last but not least, the challenge faced in the ABC region in Metropolitan S\u00e3o Paulo in terms of developing a regional public consortium that takes advantage of the new federal framework legislation, are in effect different sides of this complex and multifaceted collective learning process.<\/p>\n<p>National and state government should stimulate the negotiation and mobilisation of these territorial pacts aimed at the collective creation of public goods in metropolitan areas. After all, it is the socio-economic and political complexity as well as the richness of city-regions and metropolitan areas that allow us to go beyond the abstract macro-economic dichotomy of inflation control versus growth, which in fact has narrowed down so much of the debate on the future development of South American countries.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":"http:\/\/v0.urban-age.net\/0_downloads\/archive\/_SA\/03_NewsPaper_Essay_Klink.pdf","article_publishing_date":"December 2008","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"3","name":"Jeroen","created":"2011-08-30 07:56:37","modified":"2011-08-30 08:56:37","slug":"klink-jeroen","family_name":"Klink","title":null,"email_address":null,"photo_legacy":null,"profile_text":"<p>Jeroen Klink is the Director of Institute of Science, Technology and Society of the Federal University of the ABC Region in S\u00e3o Paulo.

Citizens spend hours in traffic. Seeking to overcome it, powerful and wealthy citizens create odious symbols of inequality, such as the exclusive road lanes for high-level bureaucrats in Moscow, or the private helicopters over S\u00e3o Paulo. Inequality is indeed the main obstacle to effective mobility solutions, as I will propose here.<\/p>\n<p>Mobility is peculiar: different from other challenges such as education or housing, it tends to get worse as societies become richer. It is particular as well, in that solutions are largely counter-intuitive: as it seems to us the Sun circles around the Earth, it seems that more road infrastructure will solve traffic jams. And, of course, both perceptions are equally flawed.<\/p>\n<p>Population growth, and all that comes with a higher income per capita, such as smaller households, larger living spaces per person, and an increase in the percentage of non-residential buildings, will make Latin American cities double or treble their built-up area over the next 50 years. It will make most Asian cities grow more than 1,000 per cent and African ones more than that, albeit over a longer period. How will mobility be solved in these giant cities?<\/p>\n<h2>BRT: not just a cheaper alternative<\/h2>\n<p>Clearly it will not be car based; public transport is the only option. But, which public transport? In the age of maglev high-speed trains, rail appears to be the obvious, modern solution. Rail manufacturers\u2019 enormous marketing and public relations budgets \u2013 and sometimes that is a euphemism \u2013 often counting on their embassies\u2019 support \u2013 reinforce this view. However, the only possible means to provide mass public transport to all inhabitants of a developing country city are bus-based systems. While S\u00e3o Paulo recent underground lines have cost US$250 (R$560) million per kilometre, Rio is constructing Bus Rapid Transport (BRT) lines for less than US$10 (R$22) million per kilometre. Operational costs are also lower for BRTs than for rail systems.<\/p>\n<p>The advantages of bus over rail are not just a matter of cost. While underground systems have some advantages over BRT, the opposite is true as well. In terms of capacity BRT is very similar to an underground system: Bogot\u00e1\u2019s TransMilenio moves up to 47,000 passengers\/hour\/direction (PHD), which is more than all of the world\u2019s underground lines, except for a handful. And there are many known ways to optimise and increase TransMilenio\u2019s speed and capacity, which have not yet been implemented. Guangzhou\u2019s BRT moves up to 37,000 PHD, more than all Chinese underground lines, except for Beijing\u2019s line number 2.<\/p>\n<p>Speed-wise express BRT lines are similar to an underground on roads without traffic lights; and it does not cost much to construct underpasses for BRT at intersections. It is usually easy to add a passing lane at stations, in order to have express routes with buses stopping only every several stations. Undergrounds cannot have express routes unless a second parallel line is built. More importantly, BRT journey times can be shorter for several reasons. When changing lines, underground passengers have to alight, walk hundreds of metres and wait for another train; BRT buses can change lines without wasting time getting off and walking to the other line. In order to carry any given amount of passengers, many more buses than trains are required. Therefore, BRT frequency is much higher, particularly at off-peak hours. This means, unpleasant waiting time at the station is shorter.<\/p>\n<p>Underground stations need to be at least one kilometre apart from each other for efficiency\u2019s sake; BRT stations can be efficiently located 500 metres apart. This means walking time from the origin of the trip to the station and from station to destination is shorter. Some BRT systems, such as Guangzhou\u2019s, operate buses in ordinary mixed-traffic streets and the BRT trunk-way in the same route; which means buses can collect passengers close to their trips\u2019 origin and leave them close to their destinations.<\/p>\n<p>Public transport users are exemplary citizens who contribute to reduce congestion. They should be rewarded with low-cost, high-quality travel. Why send them underground? It is much more pleasant to travel on the surface, enjoying natural sunlight and views of the city. It is also preferable not to spend time in long underground corridors and stairways, which, even when they are mechanical, often break down.<\/p>\n<h2>If buses are so wonderful, why weren\u2019t they preferred in London?<\/h2>\n<p>If buses are so wonderful, why weren\u2019t they preferred in London, Paris or New York? Why aren\u2019t they preferred in developing country cities? Before getting into that, let\u2019s be clear that my position is that all public transport is good and undergrounds are formidable, wonderful systems. The issue is what to do when the mobility challenge is vast and the resources to tackle it are scarce. At any rate, what should be done first?<\/p>\n<p>When the first undergrounds were built, in the late 1880s, buses did not exist. As Dinesh Mohan points out, into the first decades of the twentieth century streets were still cobblestoned, like they were during Roman times.<sup>1<\/sup> A ride on solid rubber wheels would have been rough. And the technology for pneumatic tires, which could support heavy vehicles, only appeared in the 1930s. Therefore, buses only fully entered the scene around 1940. Then they were the new thing, sexier than trams, which they replaced all over the world in a couple of decades. But of course, by then, what was truly sexy was the private car. Another reason for underground systems was that historic centres of cities, such as Paris or London, had narrow, winding streets. The only way to move fast across them was by underground.<\/p>\n<p>Developing country cities are different. They usually have large arterial roads. And they do not have a unique, well-defined centre. They have many centralities, the importance of which is ever-changing, often waning. They are well suited for BRT. But they have middle-class and high-income citizens whose political priority is to obtain more and more road space for their cars. They do not want to give up an inch of road space, existing or newly built, to buses. At the top of their demands to government are more road infrastructure and undergrounds. In very unequal developing country societies, higher-income citizens rarely have the intention of using the undergrounds they demand. They only see them as a means to reduce traffic by putting others underground, namely, bus riders.<\/p>\n<p>In more advanced developing countries, high car-ownership levels hide the fact that many households own a car, but cannot drive to work: relatively few in an office building have access to parking. The fact is that a large majority of those who drive to work in developing country cities have a higher income than most public transport users. Giving in to the pressures of the powerful society members who drive to work is what governments tend to do. It is politically easy to spend billions on undergrounds and other rail systems, which do not take space away from cars. However, it is neither the best technical, nor the most democratic option.<\/p>\n<p>If there are alternatives, it is not technically correct to prioritise a system that will only solve mobility for a small minority of a city\u2019s population, leaving the majority stranded. Not even the largest underground and suburban rail networks in developing country cities reach 15 per cent of their populations; in fact most undergrounds in those cities move less than 5 per cent of their population. Such is the case with Rio\u2019s two underground lines whose share in the city\u2019s daily trips is only 1.78 per cent. Building one underground line is expensive, and the cost per passenger increases with each additional line, as they are prioritised by demand: each additional line costs the same per kilometre, but moves progressively less passengers per kilometre.<\/p>\n<h2>Suburban rail?<\/h2>\n<p>Most developing country cities have relatively unused, often abandoned, rail lines that are said to offer a great opportunity for the operation of urban and suburban passenger rail service. Suburban rail differs from undergrounds in that it has lower acceleration and longer distances between stations, and train carriages are designed for mostly seated passengers. While suburban rail investment costs can be low, operational costs per passenger are high. When an overground urban rail line is in service, it has to be fenced off, creating an inconvenient barrier through urban areas, which also tend to deteriorate and lower the values of surrounding areas, and sometimes even foster crime. Negotiating road intersections can be complex and expensive for overground urban rail. In fact, when such urban rail corridors exist, BRT works better than rail. High-capacity BRT systems have a much higher PHD than any suburban rail line; buses can come in and out of the rail\/BRT trunk-way. And it is much simpler to solve the issue of intersections with the road network with bus underpasses, or even traffic lights.<\/p>\n<p>As for light rail or tram systems: they are pretty and usually more stable than buses, but they costs more, have lower capacities and are operationally less flexible.<\/p>\n<p>Before investing in rail, it seems logical to first use the existing road infrastructure to accommodate public transport. It does not take an MIT PhD; a committee of 12-year-olds would also conclude within half an hour that the best way to use scarce road space is with exclusive lanes for buses. An exclusive BRT lane may move up to 70 times more passengers than a lane used by cars. To clarify the issue, let\u00b4s imagine that a catastrophe leaves us with enough fuel for only 5 per cent of vehicles in a city: to whom would we allocate it? For survival, we would necessarily allocate it to trucks and buses. Now, if what is scarce is not fuel, but rather road space? Shouldn\u00b4t we do likewise?<\/p>\n<p>History shows how societies accustomed to flagrant injustices do not perceive anything wrong with them. That was the case with everything the French Revolution changed, before it happened. In the United States women could not vote for President less than 100 years ago, and African Americans had to give up their seats to white citizens in a bus until the middle of the twentieth century, and good, ordinary people and great thinkers saw nothing wrong with it. Now, a bus slowed down by traffic is as flagrantly undemocratic as women not being able to vote. If all citizens are equal before the Law, as all Constitutions state in their first article, a bus with 100 passengers has a 100 times more right to road space than a car with one.<\/p>\n<p>Road space, the space between buildings, is probably the most valuable physical asset of a city. How should we distribute it between pedestrians, cyclists, public transport and cars? Regardless of what is done, it should be clear it is neither a technical issue, nor a legal one: it is a political issue.<\/p>\n<h2>A different solution, a different way of thinking<\/h2>\n<p>Implementing solutions to this political issue requires first a different way of thinking; a democratic way of thinking that truly assumes all citizens are equal and have the same right to public assets such as road space.<\/p>\n<p>New technologies such as maglev should make rail systems faster and less costly. Bus systems will benefit from new technologies too. Driverless cars are anticipated in a few years; but driverless buses, operating on established routes, exclusive lanes in the case of BRTs, are simpler to implement and should arrive sooner. Advances in battery technologies should also make electrical buses more efficient and less costly.<\/p>\n<p>New urban design can accommodate buses in creative ways: hundreds of thousands of hectares of new cities to be built in the developing world over the next few decades could incorporate thousands of kilometres of bus-only roads along greenways, which would constitute formidable, low-cost, high-quality, public transport systems. Let\u2019s imagine a city in which clean, well-lit, safe buses, operating on exclusive lanes anywhere where there is traffic, with underpasses to avoid traffic lights, are found everywhere at all times. Above all, public transport trip times in such a bus system would be much shorter than those by private car, which would be discouraged not just by longer travel times, but also by a gamut of parking restrictions. Such a public transport system would achieve that most difficult challenge in a developing country city: get higher income citizens to use it alongside their fellow citizens. Most importantly, such a system is economically possible for any city. As a symbol, the sight of a bus moving swiftly along a bus-only lane as expensive cars stand still in traffic is a picture of democracy in action.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"<p><sup>1<\/sup> Dinesh Mohan, Mythologies, Metros &amp; Future Urban Transport,\u00a0Indian Institute of Technology, TRIPP Report Series, 2008.<\/p>\n","pdf_uri":"","article_publishing_date":"October 2013","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"4","name":"Enrique","created":"2011-08-30 10:11:50","modified":"2013-10-23 10:29:28","slug":"penalosa-enrique","family_name":"Pe\u00f1alosa","title":"","email_address":"","photo_legacy":"\/0_images\/02-EPenalosa.jpg","profile_text":"Enrique Pe\u00f1alosa, Mayor of Bogot\u00e1 1998-2001, is an urban strategist who advises cities.

With almost 70 per cent of the world\u2019s population estimated to be living in urban areas by 2050<sup>1<\/sup>, global health will be determined increasingly in cities. Yet while urbanisation has thus far generally been accompanied by many basic health improvements, today\u2019s cities currently provide some of the worst as well as some of the best environments for health.<\/p>\n<p>It is with these trends in mind that LSE Cities has embarked on a new research initiative on \u2018Cities, Health and Well-being\u2019, using the 2011 Urban Age conference in Hong Kong as a platform to promote further research and exchange over the coming years. This article has three objectives. Firstly, to provide an overview of the key issues relating the physical environment to health and well-being in cities by reviewing the literature and communicating some of the most developed understandings of healthy cities. Secondly, to provide a road map of some of the major contributions from experts in cities, health and well-being from around the world to this year\u2019s Urban Age initiative. And thirdly, to begin to set out the parameters for a framework of enquiry for future research into how cities can be designed and planned for greater urban health and well-being.<\/p>\n<h3>Are cities healthy?<\/h3>\n<p>The potential of cities to outperform the national average in wealth creation and productivity is mirrored in health. Overall, there does seem to be a health benefit to living in cities: analysis of WHO data from 90 countries shows that infant mortality rates are typically lower amongst urban populations than rural populations within individual nations<sup>2<\/sup>.\u00a0Analysis of the 41 low- and middle-income countries for which urban Demographic and Health Survey data is available shows that the proportion of children under five that are stunted \u2013 an indication of chronic malnutrition \u2013 is 1.5 times higher in rural than urban areas<sup>3<\/sup>.\u00a0However, recent research has shown that while urbanisation is associated with income, there does seem to be an additional advantage associated with living in cities.<sup>4<\/sup><\/p>\n<p>At one level, the reasons are self-evident. Part of the apparent \u2018urban health advantage\u2019 reflects the wealth that cities concentrate and produce: today, 600 cities generate 60 per cent of global GDP despite accounting for just one fifth of the world\u2019s population.<sup>5<\/sup> Cities also tend to concentrate doctors, hospitals and other health infrastructures, and provide the economies of scale necessary to support health-supporting infrastructures such as water, sanitation and drainage, as well as education and health services.<sup>6<\/sup> The proportion of births attended by skilled health personnel is 2.2 times higher in urban than rural areas on average<sup>7<\/sup> and the proportion of one year olds vaccinated for diphtheria, tetanus, toxoid and pertussis (DTP3) is 1.3 times higher in urban than rural areas.<sup>8<\/sup> Cities\u2019 health services are not just a resource for urban citizens: they also serve rural populations in their immediate vicinity and beyond.<\/p>\n<p>Compared to our knowledge of the health of rural and urban populations within nations, however, our understanding of the relative health of individual cities is much less well developed. A study coordinated by Victor Rodwin at New York University compares the health performance of London, New York, Paris, Tokyo and Hong Kong, summarised in his article on <a href=\"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/media\/objects\/articles\/health-in-hong-kong-an-international-urban-perspective\">health in Hong Kong<\/a>, stands out as a detailed comparison of five world cities but there has been no international comparison of health in cities that extends to all world regions. And while health is included within various international quality of life and \u2018livability\u2019 indices, these tend to be orientated towards the needs of businesses and investors, rather than the health and well-being of residents themselves.<sup>9<\/sup><\/p>\n<p>The lack of internationally comparable city-level health data stems from the tendency of international agencies to collect demographic and health data at a national level, through nationally representative samples that tend not to be large enough to allow for spatial disaggregation. Internationally comparable city-level data would not only improve our understanding of the health benefits and risks experienced by urban citizens, but also provide a powerful resource for urban policy-makers and politicians. To this end, LSE Cities has developed an internationally comparable health index for 129 extended metropolitan regions, using a range of available data, including infant mortality and life expectancy. The preliminary findings are set out in pp. 10\u201313, and the full methodology and points for discussion are explained at urban-age.net.<sup>10<\/sup><\/p>\n<h3>Can cities damage your health?<\/h3>\n<p class=\"has-pullquote\" data-pullquote=\"The urban poor are less likely to be included in censuses and surveys, and where they are, data is often aggregated spatially, masking the significant health differentials that exist within cities.\">Most rural versus urban and city-to-city health comparisons tell us nothing about the distribution of health within cities. In fact, the resources and associated health benefits that cities concentrate are not shared evenly amongst their residents.<sup>11<\/sup> As Ernestina Coast explains <a href=\"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/media\/objects\/articles\/health-and-the-urban-poor\">in her article<\/a>, the urban poor are less likely to be included in censuses and surveys, and where they are, data is often aggregated spatially, masking the significant health differentials that exist within cities. The 828 million people estimated to be living in informal settlements in the developing world in 2010<sup>12<\/sup> face multiple health risks from birth. Poor housing, lack of infrastructure and access to basic services leave residents of informal settlements (and particularly children) vulnerable to communicable diseases, such as respiratory and gastrointestinal illnesses, malaria and accidents and injuries.<sup>13<\/sup> Analysis of WHO data from 154 countries shows that the percentage of the population living in urban slum conditions is inversely associated with infant mortality, independent of the urbanisation of the country or its income.<sup>14<\/sup> Areas of concentrated disadvantage seem to have worse health outcomes irrespective of the level of development.<sup>15<\/sup><\/p>\n<p>Analysis from the African Population and Health Research Centre, based on 1999 data, shows that children living in Nairobi, Kenya, are less likely to die before the age of five than in Kenya as a whole (under-five mortality rate of 61 per 1,000 births, compared to 112 per 1,000 births), but the children of Nairobi\u2019s informal settlements are more likely to do so (151 per 1,000 births).<sup>16<\/sup> At the same time, non-communicable diseases (NCDs), such as stroke, cancer and diabetes are increasing amongst low-income urban residents, creating a cruel \u2018double-burden\u2019 of disease.<sup>17<\/sup> NCDs can, therefore, no longer accurately be considered to be diseases of the rich, whether in towns or the countryside, and it is estimated that by 2020, they will be responsible for 69 per cent of all deaths in low- and middle-income countries.<sup>18<\/sup> In the case of Accra, Ghana, and S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, detailed analysis of health outcomes across the two cities showed that more people died of both circulatory diseases and infectious\/parasitic diseases in the most deprived zones than the least deprived zones (see Table 1).<sup>19<\/sup> Road traffic accidents and violence are other growing global health threats, responsible for 1.3 million and 1.6 million deaths respectively each year,<sup>20<\/sup> compounding the urban poor\u2019s double burden of infectious and parasitic disease and NCDs into a \u2018triple-burden\u2019.<sup>21<\/sup> Finally, mental health disorders make up an increasing proportion of global disease burden: unipolar depression is the third leading cause of disease worldwide, and is high even in low-income countries (eighth place, compared to first place for middle- and high-income countries),<sup>22<\/sup> and are particularly prevalent in cities, as Mazda Adli demonstrates\u00a0in his piece on <a href=\"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/media\/objects\/articles\/urban-stress-and-mental-health\">urban stress and mental health<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Urban health inequalities also exist in rich countries, although they are usually more extreme and felt by a greater proportion of the urban population in poorer countries. In London, the inequalities that existed between the (poor) east and the (rich) west in the late nineteenth century, as documented by Charles Booth in his surveys into life and labour in London, are clearly visible today. For example, at 82.4 years, while female life expectancy in London is slightly higher than the average for England of 81.8 years, it is significantly lower in Newham, inner east London, at 79.8 years.<sup>23<\/sup> London\u2019s health inequalities are directly related to its socioeconomic inequalities, which are concentrated spatially in specific boroughs and neighbourhoods. As Stephen O\u2019Brien writes <a href=\"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/media\/objects\/articles\/east-enders\">in his essay<\/a>, \u2018there needs to be a revolutionary attack on health inequalities in east London and it needs to begin now\u2019.<\/p>\n<p>In Hong Kong, despite the significant reductions in child mortality achieved over the past 30 years, higher rates are spatially concentrated in particular parts of the New Territories. Analysis from LSE Cities explored in detail on pp. 36\u20139, shows that in these areas, for example, child mortality is between 17 and 35 deaths per 1,000 live births, compared to an average of four for Hong Kong as a whole. The spatial variation in health performance closely mirrors the distribution of deprivation in Hong Kong: Hong Kong\u2019s 20 per cent most deprived areas have child mortality rates 3 times the Hong Kong average. Such patterns are also found in other health indicators in Hong Kong. As Paul Yip explains in <a href=\"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/media\/objects\/articles\/disconnection-in-a-highly-connected-city\">&#8216;Disconnection in a highly connected city&#8217;<\/a>, suicide rates in Hong Kong\u2019s newly developed satellite towns in the north and northwestern districts are 16 to 25 per cent higher than in Hong Kong on average. Yet such areas provide far from the worse living conditions in Hong Kong. The Society for Community Organization bring life to the statistic that some 80,000 people in Hong Kong live in woefully inadequate conditions, such as \u2018cage homes\u2019, cubicles and rooftop constructions, through a series of portraits of residents. If, as Yip concludes, \u2018a city is only as strong as its weakest link\u2019, Hong Kong\u2019s health inequalities deserve further attention.<\/p>\n<p>The link between health and social inequality is a key focus of the \u2018social determinants\u2019 approach to health, spear-headed by Michael Marmot and the WHO\u2019s Commission on the Social Determinants of Health<sup>24<\/sup> In this perspective, health is not only determined by individual factors, such as our age, sex and genetic characteristics, but also by our social status and the conditions in which we live. The unequal distribution of social goods and urban amenities within cities is reflected in health inequalities that are often clearly visible, both on maps and within cities themselves. Even within the same city, urban areas can provide some of the best and worse environments for health. A comprehensive review of ill health and poverty suggests that the \u2018urban advantage\u2019 often assumed by governments and international agencies falls away when socioeconomic factors are taken into account.<sup>25<\/sup> Analysis of data from 47 low- and middle-income countries found an urban advantage in child health in only three countries.<sup>26<\/sup> In Sub-Saharan Africa, this advantage was maintained only in one country (Malawi) of the 15 analysed, once socioeconomic status was taken into account.<sup>27<\/sup> The health benefits of cities do not come automatically \u2013 they depend on the ability and willingness of governments to provide essential services and infrastructure.<\/p>\n<h3>Can we be healthy and happy in cities?<\/h3>\n<p class=\"has-pullquote\" data-pullquote=\"Well-being is a much broader term than health. It connotes being well psychologically, physically, socioeconomically, and even culturally.\">Well-being is a much broader term than health. It encompasses a wide range of issues and can be defined and measured in a variety of different ways, depending on the particular theory of well-being understood.<sup>28<\/sup> Well-being can incorporate both objective needs, such as decent housing and income (often collectively termed, \u2018quality of life\u2019 or \u2018standard of living\u2019), and subjective feelings of happiness and life satisfaction. One definition captures the meaning of well-being particularly well: \u2018it connotes being well psychologically, physically, and socioeconomically, and, we should add, culturally: it is all these things working together\u2019.<sup>29<\/sup> The WHO definition of health, which has now stood for over 60 years, actually encompasses well-being: \u2018a state of complete, physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity\u2019.<sup>30<\/sup> This definition implies that to be healthy is not only to be free of disease but also the ability to make a living, to live in decent conditions, to have access to basic services, to engage in social relationships and to feel able to affect one\u2019s own circumstances.<\/p>\n<p>Well-being is once again gaining political ground in many parts of the world, as an alternative and broader measure of welfare than GDP alone. In the United Kingdom, the first national surveys of happiness are currently underway; in France, President Nicholas Sarkozy is integrating the measurement of well-being into the analysis of the country\u2019s performance. These efforts confirm what the post-World War II architects of systems of national accounts knew 75 years ago: that welfare could not be measured by GDP alone.<sup>31<\/sup> US presidential candidate Robert Kennedy said in 1968:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The gross national product does not allow for the health of our children, the quality of their education, or the joy of their play. It does not include the beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages, the intelligence of our public debate or the integrity of our public officials \u2026 it measures everything, in short, except that which makes life worthwhile.<sup>32<\/sup><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p class=\"has-pullquote\" data-pullquote=\"The problem is, we don\u2019t know which cities are performing well, and which are not, and therefore our ability to explore the determinants of well-being in cities, and hence to inform urban policy, is limited.\">Cities are now recognised as the economic powerhouses of their nations, and of the world. They also have the potential to be great sources of human well-being. The problem is, we don\u2019t know which cities are performing well, and which are not, and therefore our ability to explore the determinants of well-being in cities, and hence to inform urban policy, is limited. There remains \u2018an implicit assumption in the dominant aspatial thinking about wellbeing, namely that once we control for personal characteristics, places all yield the same level of subjective wellbeing to their residents\u2019.<sup>33<\/sup> As Paul Dolan and Robert Metcalfe point out in their essay on <a href=\"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/media\/objects\/articles\/movin-on-up-happiness-and-urban-economics\">happiness and economics<\/a>, we do not yet have the evidence on what makes us happy, including in relation to neighbourhoods and cities. In Hong Kong, Lok Sang Ho has developed a <a href=\"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/media\/objects\/articles\/making-a-happier-hong-kong\">\u2018happiness index\u2019<\/a>. He thinks through the implications account of this new indicator of social progress for public policy in this publication, suggesting that a more relaxed stance on land supply might help to create a happier Hong Kong. Based on its <a href=\"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/media\/objects\/articles\/measuring-metropolitan-well-being\">global study of metropolitan well-being<\/a>, LSE Cities expands the comparison of health in 129 extended metropolitan regions to encompass education and wealth, in a first attempt to develop an international comparison of urban well-being.<\/p>\n<h3>Do planning and design matter?<\/h3>\n<p>The importance of the physical environment to health in cities has been known for more than 100 years. Indeed, public health and urban planning share a common history in the escalating health problems that arose in many European and US cities in the nineteenth century as they rapidly industrialised and grew. At that time, disease was understood to be caused by \u2018miasma\u2019 and, following John Snow\u2019s work on a cholera outbreak in Soho, London, in 1854, by \u2018contagious entities\u2019, a pre-cursor to modern germ theory. The miasma theory held that diseases such as cholera and typhoid were caused by a foul-smelling bad vapour or mist (miasma). Infections were not passed between people, but were rather caused by exposure to unhealthy environmental conditions that gave off bad air. In England, this theory informed Edwin Chadwick\u2019s sanitation reforms, which aimed to separate households from the disease-causing \u2018bad air\u2019 understood to be given off by sewage through the construction of drainage systems.<sup>34<\/sup> It also led to more comprehensive city rebuilding, motivated by a desire to separate both the activities and populations thought to cause disease and thus reduce the risk of contact with bad air and hence infection. Haussmann\u2019s plan for Paris is a prime example.<\/p>\n<p>Health also provided a strong motivation for some of the most influential architecture and planning movements of the twentieth century. Ebenezer Howard\u2019s vision of a \u2018garden city\u2019, for example, aimed to marry the best of town and country in a connected cluster of \u2018slumless and smokeless cities\u2019. Le Corbusier was motivated by many of the same issues: how to create better living conditions in cities. His vision for a healthy city was, of course, very different, in which cities were razed and built anew, with high-rise towers providing decent housing, amenities and services for the working classes, between which people moved freely in their cars along wide and extensive motorways, and where they could enjoy parks and gardens.<\/p>\n<p class='has-pullquote' data-pullquote='Today, health is no longer a central control of urban planning policy, and vice versa'>It is fair to say, however, that today health is no longer a central control of urban planning policy or practice, and vice versa. The development of germ theory had a profound impact on public health, as it focused increasingly on universal health care, public immunisation plans and the targeting of individual behaviours such as diet, smoking and physical activity, rather than living conditions. Bucking this trend, the environmental health movement and the WHO\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.healthycities.org.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\">Healthy Cities project<\/a> have made significant efforts in recent decades to reconnect public health with its concern for the urban environment. While the environmental health movement grew strongly out of the health challenges facing low- and middle-income countries, the Healthy Cities project has its roots in the contexts and concerns of high-income countries in North America and Western Europe. Despite its appeal and visibility, as well as the moderate progress achieved by cities towards fulfilling the Healthy Cities project requirements, it has been much more successful in Europe than in developing world regions.<sup>35 <\/sup><\/p>\n<p>Urban health and planning researchers have focused their attention both on the challenges facing cities in North America and Western Europe, such as rising obesity rates, increasing use of private vehicles, road traffic injuries and fear of crime, and on the continuing inadequacy of basic infrastructure such as sanitation, water and drainage in parts of many cities in low- and middle-income countries. There is now fairly strong evidence to support the existence of relationships between insufficient\/inadequate basic infrastructure and infectious disease; housing quality and injury; respiratory disease and other mental and physical health risks; green space and mental health; and urban morphology and physical activity. This evidence has been systematically reviewed by several international networks, including the Rockefeller Foundation supported <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ucl.ac.uk\/gheg\/GRNUHE\" target=\"_blank\">Global Research Network on Urban Health Equity<\/a> and the WHO\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.who.int\/social_determinants\/themes\/urbanization\/en\/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Knowledge Network on Urban Settings<\/a>, as well as by the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.instituteofhealthequity.org\/projects\/built-environment-marmot-review-task-group-report\" target=\"_blank\">Marmot review working group<\/a> on the built environment and health equity and a range of other authors. Together, these reviews provide a substantial and thorough overview of the field.<sup>36<\/sup><\/p>\n<h3>Shifting health and urban agendas<\/h3>\n<p>As health patterns and urban forms shift and change, the need for research and policy on urban health to move beyond its roots in European and North American concerns becomes ever clearer, as Libby Burton acknowledges <a href=\"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/media\/objects\/articles\/the-built-environment-and-childrens-well-being\">in her review<\/a> of the evidence linking aspects of the built environment to children\u2019s well-being. The disparity between the health burdens experienced by the urban poor in low- and middle-income countries and the focus of much urban health research on cities in rich nations is particularly clear. But, in fact, as high-income Asian, Eastern European and other countries are much more rarely the subject of urban health research than cities in Western Europe, North America and Australasia, it is also important to extend analysis to cities such as Singapore, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Osaka, which perform strongly in relation to life expectancy and infant mortality internationally (see <a href=\"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/media\/objects\/articles\/measuring-metropolitan-well-being\">&#8216;Measuring metropolitan well-being&#8217;<\/a>), and may provide useful insights for other cities. Overall, a nuanced approach is needed, sensitive to the wide range of urban morphologies and contexts of different cities throughout the world. The following examples provide a sense of some of the issues to contend with.<\/p>\n<h4>Water and sanitation<\/h4>\n<p>According to a 1990 study of the health benefits associated with improved water supply and sanitation, such interventions have achieved between a 20 and 82 per cent reduction rate in child mortality, with the best six studies suggesting a median reduction rate of 55 per cent.<sup>37<\/sup> Contamination of water can also occur in the home, rather than in the water source itself: household water containers have been found to have higher levels of faecal contaminants than the water sources themselves.<sup>38<\/sup> Sanitation is an equally complex matter: David Satterthwaite argues that the levels of improvement in sanitation facilities targeted by the Millennium Development Goals are insufficient to secure the relevant health benefits: simple pit latrines with a slab, for example.<sup>39<\/sup> Sanitation interventions must also be culturally, socially and economically appropriate if they are to be effective: relying on unrealistic levels of personal investment or hygiene practices that are impossible to carry out is not likely to lead to a sustained improvement.<sup>40<\/sup> Supplying adequate water and sanitation should not, therefore, be viewed as a \u2018technical fix\u2019 that is well understood and easily implementable.<sup>41<\/sup><\/p>\n<p>In Mumbai, the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.alfred-herrhausen-society.org\/en\/754.html\" target=\"_blank\">Triratna Prerana Mandal initiative<\/a> (TPM) built on its ten years\u2019 experience in cleaning and maintaining shared neighbourhood toilets by constructing 16 new local public toilet blocks between 2001 and 2003.<sup>42<\/sup> TPM\u2019s activities did not stop, however, at the construction of the blocks; not only did they continue to maintain these blocks, keeping them usable and hygienic, they also used the space above and around them to run activities and services, including computer classes, a childcare centre, a recycling initiative and to support women\u2019s groups in providing meals for 2,000 undernourished children each day. These activities played a crucial role in keeping the toilet blocks safe for women and children to use, as well as creating new opportunities for the surrounding communities. TPM provides an example of how public health interventions can be effectively supported and enhanced by broader initiatives, improving well-being as well as health.<\/p>\n<p class=\"has-pullquote\" data-pullquote=\"The case of Maputo provides important insights into what can be achieved with limited resources if a city government is willing to plan with, rather than for, its people\">In <a href=\"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/media\/objects\/articles\/urban-development-in-maputo\">the case of Maputo<\/a>, Mozambique, explored in detail by J\u00f8rgen Eskemose Andersen and Paul Jenkins, it was the city government that took the lead through proactive action to manage urban growth despite limited resources. Eskemose Andersen and Jenkins describe how, rather than continue with a costly urban upgrading project initiated by the national government and the UN in the 1970s, the newly formed Greater Maputo city council launched a strategic programme in the early 1980s to \u2018get ahead\u2019 of burgeoning residential land demand by the provision of sites with minimal services. The plots were marked out quickly and simply in a grid formation and \u2018barefoot planners\u2019 provided construction advice and land control, and assisted with a subsidised basic sanitation programme. Some 30 years on, the intended spatial order has been maintained, permitting subsequent provision of infrastructure and social facilities by the municipal government and private companies, at a much lower cost due to the structured layouts. As Eskemose Andersen and Jenkins argue, the case of Maputo provides important insights into what can be achieved with limited resources if a city government is willing to plan with, rather than for, its people.<\/p>\n<h4>Housing<\/h4>\n<p>There is strong evidence supporting a link between housing and a host of physical and mental health problems. Housing is important to health not only for the quality of the shelter it provides from heat, cold, noise, rain, dust and so on, but also in relation to the water and sanitation infrastructure it provides, whether it offers a safe environment for storing food, cooking and working, and whether it presents risks to health due to overcrowding, amongst other matters.<sup>43<\/sup> Inadequate housing is associated with increased bronchitis, pneumonia, stroke, heart disease and accidents, for example, while overcrowding is associated with infections, stress and intra-family violence.<sup>44<\/sup><\/p>\n<p>This evidence has and continues to provide strong motivation for slum upgrading projects and housing renewal programmes throughout the world, whether in Hong Kong, London or Mumbai. Yet many such programmes actually fail to improve the health of residents. Here, McGonigle and Kirby\u2019s legendary study of a slum demolition and rehousing project in Stockton-on-Tees in England in 1929, which actually led to an increase in death rates amongst re-housed groups, provides insights that remain relevant today.<sup>45<\/sup> A replacement housing project for pavement dwellers next to the Shivaji Nagar informal settlement in Govandi, Mumbai, provides a more recent but equally compelling example. Prior to a street-widening scheme, which triggered their eviction and rehousing, these migrants from a nearby fishing village lived and worked on Mumbai\u2019s pavements, weaving baskets from long bamboo stalks and selling their wares to the passing trade. Rehoused in small apartments with no space inside for basket weaving, no passing trade and facing a long commute to the city centre, the former pavement dwellers lost their source of livelihood. Without money to pay for electricity, the buildings\u2019 lifts were out of service and became a health hazard as they filled up with rubbish and attracted rats. For these migrants, the bleak conditions of the pavement had been replaced by what rapidly became a \u2018vertical slum\u2019, and was made worse by their loss of income, suggesting that improvements in basic living conditions alone will not necessarily result in improvements to health.<\/p>\n<p>Housing replacement or renewal projects that take the broader economic and social role of housing into account have the potential to have a more positive overall impact on residents\u2019 health and well-being. In his article, David Satterthwaite provides a series of examples of housing improvement and slum upgrading programmes that have been more sensitive to these issues: Thailand\u2019s Baan Mankong (secure housing) programme funds community groups to plan and improve their own conditions, while a project in Pune, India, managed by a federation of women\u2019s savings groups, engages each household in developing and agreeing planned upgrades. In Karachi, Pakistan, the architect and researcher Arif Hasan proposes an alternative approach to upgrading settlements \u2013 high-density plot settlements rather than apartment complexes \u2013 based on careful research with residents of four low- and middle-income areas. Hasan\u2019s alternative model better reflects the ways in which residents use their homes: expanding them incrementally to house married children and carrying out income-generating activities. He also recommends that technical advice be made available to residents to ensure that any upgrading or incremental building they do is safe and does not lead to unhealthy densities. Hasan has been asked to put his plans into practice for a housing project in Lahore.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"\/files\/2011\/11\/Central04.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-889 alignleft\" title=\"Central04\" src=\"\/files\/2011\/11\/Central04.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h4>Urban morphology<\/h4>\n<p>The most common NCDs (heart disease, cancer, type 2 diabetes and respiratory disease) now account for 60 per cent of global deaths each year, driven by the profound lifestyle changes that have accompanied economic and social change.<sup>46<\/sup> In light of the importance of physical activity in reducing the risk of these diseases, substantial efforts have been made to identify the potential of the built environment to encourage or inhibit physical activity. Much of the evidence hinges on whether urban sprawl \u2013 in and of itself \u2013 leads to greater private car use.<sup>47<\/sup> However, the issue is more subtle than that, leading to the idea of an area needing to have a variety of characteristics in order to be a \u2018walkable neighbourhood\u2019: high density, mix of land uses, fine-grained street networks and human-scaled streets.<sup>48<\/sup> While good evidence exists to support the idea that residents of \u2018walkable neighbourhoods\u2019 walk more than residents of less \u2018walkable neighbourhoods\u2019 (at least twice as many, according to a review of 11 North American studies,<sup>49<\/sup> for example), the lack of longitudinal studies mean that it is not clear to what extent this reflects the choices of residents to live in a neighbourhood that meets their walking preferences.<\/p>\n<p>Obesity and NCDs are, however, no longer just a problem of the United States, Europe and Australasia. Indeed, they are growing fastest in low- and middle-income countries, and are predicted to continue doing so.<sup>50<\/sup> The health challenges facing Singapore today, for example, are very different to those of 50 years ago, as K. S. Chia, C. K. Heng and K. C. Ho explain in their article on <a href=\"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/media\/objects\/articles\/the-challenges-of-being-open\">the challenges for a city open to migration<\/a>. Diabetes and obesity are on the rise, raising questions about how physical activity can be better incorporated within working life and recreation within a hyper-dense environment.<\/p>\n<p>Taking another example, in China, 14.7 per cent of the population is now overweight and 2.6 per cent is obese (2002 figures).<sup>51<\/sup> While these statistics remain low in relation to the US and other Western countries, they have been rising rapidly, particularly amongst young people. Obesity increased four times between 1985 and 2000, while obesity and overweight together increased 28 times over the same period.<sup>52<\/sup> Changes in diet, increasing wealth, sedentary lifestyles, reduced physical activity and passive commuting have all played a part in driving these increases. Here, the built environment of many Chinese cities also poses significant challenges: Yangfeng Wu, from the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, explains, \u2018the lack of consideration towards constructing environments in inner cities that promote physical activity has meant that it has become increasingly difficult to find safe places in residential areas to exercise or even walk\u2019.<sup>53 <\/sup>Yet in Shanghai, for example, 25.2 per cent of people still travel to work by bike: the highest by far of the ten Urban Age cities, Berlin being the only other city where any significant proportion of people cycle to work (7.6 per cent).<sup>54<\/sup><\/p>\n<p>Is it possible that the existing Western-orientated research on urban sprawl and physical activity might offer any insights in such different urban environments? In the case of Cape Town, Warren Smit and Vanessa Watson draw on <a href=\"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/media\/objects\/articles\/the-african-centre-for-cities%E2%80%99-healthy-cities-citylab\">the initial results<\/a> of their Healthy Cities CityLab to conclude that the Western modernist assumptions underpinning existing research do not relate to the conditions of African urbanism. The neat separations and definitions of Western city streets and units on which assessments of \u2018walkability\u2019 are based are not present in Cape Town, they say, and the relationships between the movement of residents and their neighbourhood environment are much more complex. Thus, the increasing prevalence of NCDs in cities beyond North America, Australia and Europe calls for new approaches to research and associated policy and practice on the potential for urban design and planning to increase physical activity, which accommodate\u00a0the broader health and well-being needs\u00a0of the urban poor in low- and middle-income countries.<\/p>\n<h4>Green space<\/h4>\n<p class=\"has-pullquote\" data-pullquote=\"People living in cities are more likely to suffer from psychiatric diseases such as major depression or schizophrenia\">Urban health research and policy has thus far been very much more focused on physical health than mental health, despite the fact that major depression is expected to generate the second highest loss of so-called disability-adjusted life years (DALYs; the sum of years of potential life lost due to premature mortality and the years of productive life lost due to disability<sup>55<\/sup>) by 2030.<sup>56<\/sup> As Mazda Adli explains in his article on <a href=\"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/media\/objects\/articles\/urban-stress-and-mental-health\">stress and the city<\/a>, people living in cities are more likely to suffer from psychiatric diseases such as major depression or schizophrenia due in part, it is thought, to higher stress exposure and vulnerability. Adli, a psychiatrist, explains the significant range of impacts stress has on the body, from restructuring body fat, suppressing the immune system, premature ageing, to increased risk of mental disorder.<\/p>\n<p>Strong evidence exists to suggest that experiencing and viewing nature reduces the stress of daily urban life, and parks, gardens, trees and greenery are all significant in this.<sup>57<\/sup> In Hong Kong, urban parks have a particular importance to elderly people, who are their most frequent users.<sup>58<\/sup> The early morning sight of elderly people practicing tai chi or walking for exercise in Hong Kong\u2019s parks and gardens is ubiquitous. Playing with children, enjoying the space and social activities are other significant uses: the parks are social spaces as well as spaces for exercising.<sup>59<\/sup> In fast-paced Hong Kong, they also have a particular role in providing a space for people to relax.<sup>60<\/sup> For many of the young people we spoke to as part of <a href=\"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/media\/objects\/articles\/living-at-density\">qualitative research<\/a> carried out by LSE Cities and the Hong Kong Jockey Club Centre for Suicide Research and Prevention at the University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong\u2019s urban public and green spaces felt inaccessible, being full of children and the elderly. Rather, they turned to restaurants and badminton courts if they wanted to relax with friends, and to listening to music through headphones if they wanted some privacy and time to themselves. The importance of green space in ameliorating stress and mental health disorders in cities beyond Europe and North America justifies further examination, in light of the strong evidence linking these issues and the growing problem of stress and mental health.<sup>61<\/sup><\/p>\n<h3>Shaping cities for health: what next?<\/h3>\n<p>As urban health research, policy and practice shifts its geographies towards a broader range of urban contexts, new methodologies and approaches will be required. Here we offer a few suggestions for potential directions of travel.<\/p>\n<p>\u2018Design-conscious\u2019 methodologies might provide more insight into the precise ways in which the built environment may be influencing health and well-being in a particular setting. Urban design and planning \u2013 from the macro-scale of sprawl versus compact development, and private car use versus sustainable transport, to the micro-scale of public space design, access to daylight, trees and recreational spaces \u2013 all matter to the way we feel about living in cities. Design-conscious urban health research would be alert to the details that are important in determining, for example, the extent to which an urban park is used by families, whether a health care facility is used by the urban poor, or a rehousing scheme allows for residents to adapt their homes in a safe way, avoiding the temptation to blur them through over-simplistic references to \u2018the built environment\u2019.<\/p>\n<p class=\"has-pullquote\" data-pullquote=\"Setting such design-conscious and qualitative analyses in dialogue with quantitative public health science, both between and within cities, may provide a powerful combination.\">Qualitative methodologies might help to provide insights into health and well-being as experienced by urban residents. As Mathews and Izquierdo note, the term well-being \u2018implies consideration of people\u2019s own internal states of mind\u2019,<sup>62<\/sup> as well as the sorts of external and quantitative evaluations associated more with the term, quality of life. The <a href=\"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/media\/objects\/articles\/living-at-density\">six focus groups<\/a> conducted by LSE Cities and the Hong Kong Jockey Club Centre for Suicide Research and Prevention at the University of Hong Kong provided insight not only into how residents felt density impacted on their health and well-being but also, more importantly, into the ways in which they themselves make density work in Hong Kong, by adapting their behaviour and negotiating their environments. Setting such design-conscious and qualitative analyses in dialogue with quantitative public health science, both between and within cities, as explored earlier in this essay, may provide a powerful combination.<\/p>\n<p>A spatial approach to urban health and well-being would give greater emphasis to the substantial health inequalities within cities, to the experience of health in place, and to the potential for the shape and design of the urban environment to influence human health and well-being. It could more explicitly show how the social hierarchies that take centre-stage in the social determinants approach are played out across the spaces and places of cities, visible in spatial inequalities in urban infrastructure as well as in socioeconomic and health status. It would require more focus on cities themselves and places and spaces within them, rather than spaceless and placeless \u2018rural\u2019 and \u2018urban\u2019 populations. It would communicate more clearly how insufficient, wrongly located or poorly designed infrastructure and amenities can reinforce and deepen social and health inequalities.<\/p>\n<p>To recognise the politics of urban health involves indentifying that the decisions made by city mayors, developers, transport planners, urban designers, architects and city residents themselves matter to health and well-being: whether to have a green belt or invite endless sprawl; to invest in road-building or in public buses and trains; to take intentional and careful steps to create active and lively streets that encourage walking and mixing or to create segregated mono-functional enclaves that keep people apart. How dense should housing development be, and how can this be sensitive to the trade-offs that people make? How should the progressive improvement and \u2018retrofitting\u2019 of informal settlements be allowed for, or the growth through \u2018barefoot\u2019 planning be anticipated? Where should new hospitals or local health facilities be built, and what should they look like? Implications for human health and well-being accompany the decision in each case.<\/p>\n<p>Yet in many cases, as we know, urban governance is likely to be part of the problem, rather than part of the solution. Many informal settlements, where some of the most pressing challenges to health occur, are almost by definition places where urban governance lacks the capability and\/or capacity to provide infrastructure needed to support healthy homes and livelihoods. As David Satterthwaite writes, \u2018what advice can be given with regard to urban health in settlements where, in effect, there is no government?\u2019.<sup>63<\/sup> More pointedly, what is the point of advocating that urban planning and public health should be reconnected if no attempt at urban planning is being made, or where planning is failing? By bringing urban actors, whether developers, residents, community groups or politicians themselves into the equation, we hope to open up dialogue on how positive change can be achieved in diverse settings.<\/p>\n<p>The Urban Age Hong Kong conference provides an opportunity to contribute to the development of these and other methodologies and approaches. It is defined not only by an interest in reading between research, policy and practice on urban health from cities in low-, middle- and high-income countries but also in setting quantitative, qualitative and design perspectives in conversation, and emphasising the spatial and political nature of urban health and well-being.<\/p>\n<p><em>\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"<p>References<\/p>\n<p>1 UN Population Division (2010) <em>World Population Prospects \u2013 The 2010 Revision.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>2 Dye, C.

As we move into the twenty-first century, a rapidly growing number of cities have re-emerged as strategic places for a wide range of activities and dynamics. Critical, and partly underlying all the other dimensions, is the new economic role of cities in an increasingly globalised world, and the associated architectural and technical revolutions.<\/p>\n<p>Much is known about the wealth and power of today\u2019s global firms and global financial exchanges. Their ascendance in a globalising world is no longer surprising. And the new information and communication technologies are typically seen as the handmaiden of economic globalisation \u2013 both tool and infrastructure.<\/p>\n<p>Less clear is why cities should matter more today in a globalised world than they did in the Keynesian world of the mid-1900s. In this essay I sketch a general answer. Not being an expert on Mumbai, or on the rapid and complex globalisation of Indian cities and regions, all I can do is hope that specialised researchers can fill in the blanks. Nevertheless, if I were investigating Mumbai, I would want to see where I would arrive with the analytics of global urban circuits that I propose.<\/p>\n<p>In the earlier period, cities were above all centres for administration, small-scale manufacturing, and commerce. Cities were mostly the space for rather routinised endeavours. The strategic spaces where the major innovations were happening were government, that is the making of social contracts, such as the welfare state, and mass-manufacturing, which included the massive construction of suburban regions. The most common and easiest answers as to why cities have become strategic sites in a global corporate economy are first the ongoing need for face-to-face communications and second the need for creative classes and inputs. There is truth in both notions. But in my reading these are surface conditions \u2013 the consequences of a deeper structural transformation. It is in the latter transformation in which the answer can be found. The next few sections develop this.<\/p>\n<p>The outcomes of new structural conditions get wired into urban space. In fact, urban space itself is one of the factors producing the outcome of this process. This partly explains why architecture, urban design and urban planning have each played such critical roles. Beginning in the 1980s, we have seen the selective rebuilding of cities as platforms for a rapidly growing range of globalised activities and flows, from economic to cultural and political.<\/p>\n<p>When I first developed the global city model in the 1980s, my starting point were the global networks of affiliates of firms, global financial exchanges, global trade routes, and global commodity chains. The emergent scholarship on globalisation examining these global operations emphasised geographic dispersal, decentralisation, deterritorialisation. This was indeed all happening. But I was interested in the territorial moment of all these increasingly electronic and globally dispersed operations. At that time, using the methodology of starting with global operations and tracking the sites where they hit the ground, led me recognise that the cities that stood out were New York, London and Tokyo. Applying this methodology today results in a vastly expanded global geography of sites. There is more of everything \u2013 export processing zones; offshore banking centres; massive warehouses that are one stop on global trade routes; and many more global cities.<\/p>\n<p>In my research practice I use five analytic steps to capture this territorial moment of the global economy. In turn this allows the researcher to analyse in great detail how a particular city is articulated with the global economy. These analytic steps also carry the researcher deep inside the city. They do so not through some general descriptive approach, but in very specific, and selective, ways. Figuratively speaking, the researcher rides the variety of global circuits as they hit the ground in the city and get wired into urban space.<\/p>\n<p>Riding these circuits allows the researcher to arrive at parts of the city that look like they have nothing to do with the global economy. In the case of New York and most other major global cities in the advanced capitalist core, this includes a new type of informal economy that brings flexibility, customisation, and speed to tasks that are otherwise part of routinised and slow sectors. No one can imagine that Manhattan\u2019s Wall Street and the corporate midtown centre, or the world-class Broadway theatre district and Metropolitan Opera are actually articulated with local informal economies. They are. In what follows I briefly present the analytics I propose to engage with global urban circuits.<\/p>\n<p>There is no such entity as \u2018the\u2019 global economy. Rather, there is a vast multiplication of global circuits that crisscross the world, some specialised some not. Different circuits contain different groups of countries and cities. The task then becomes to establish what global\/regional circuits a city is located on, and what other cities partake in each of these circuits. This analytical operation makes the global economy concrete, enabling research on global cities.<\/p>\n<p>Thus, if I were to track the global circuits of gold as a financial instrument, London, New York, Chicago and Zurich would dominate. But if I track the direct trading in the metal, Johannesburg, Mumbai, Dubai, and Sydney all appear on the map. This also brings out the important fact that it is not just a question of competition among cities, but in good part a division of specialised functions with global scope. Increasingly, these urban economies are part of a networked global platform.<\/p>\n<p>Not only global economic forces feed this proliferation of circuits. Global migration, cultural work, civil society struggles around global issues (human rights, the environment, social justice), these and others also feed the formation and development of global circuits. Detailed research from the perspective of a given city makes the diversity and specificity of its location on these circuits legible. The research also makes the city\u2019s linkages with other cities through specific circuits legible.<\/p>\n<p>My argument is that these emergent inter-city geographies begin to function as an infrastructure for globalisation. And they increasingly urbanise global networks. Cities can generate different kinds of \u2018knowledge,\u2019 both formal and informal. Suck knowledge extends beyond the sum of recognised knowledge-producing actors in the economy (e.g. professionals and consulting firms). It is a type of immaterial capital that we can call \u2018urban knowledge capital.\u2019 Part of the explanation is that cities are fuzzy-logic systems. Hence they enable scale-jumping, or the switch from the mere sum of what is there to a third type of capability.<\/p>\n<p>Particular urban, metro and regional spaces are becoming massive concentrations of new technical capabilities. Also, a growing number of buildings constitute sites for the multiplication of interactive technologies and distributed computing. And particular global communication infrastructures connect specific sets of buildings worldwide, producing a highly specialised interactive geography. Global firms are willing to pay a high premium in order to be located in it.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, the global business network of AT&amp;T now connects about 485,000 buildings worldwide. This is a specific geography that actually fragments the cities where these buildings are located. You need to be in a \u2018member\u2019 building to access the network. The most highly valued areas of global cities, particularly financial centres, now contain communication infrastructures that can be separated from the rest of the city. This allows continuous upgrading without having to spread development to the rest of the city. Contained in strategic areas are particular technical capabilities, such as frame relays, which most of the city does not. Multiplying this case for thousands of multinational firms begins to give us an idea of the new inter-city connectivity that is largely invisible to the average resident.<\/p>\n<p>If we consider these globally networked spaces of centrality as platforms for global operations of firms and markets, we might ask what components of these platforms are contained within a given city-region. Finally, it is noteworthy that these platforms cut across national boundaries. They are an amalgamation of specific sub-national geographic spaces but also transnational electronic spaces.<\/p>\n<p>Of increasing importance in the globalised economy is the deep economic history of a place and the specialised economic strengths it can generate. This goes against the common view that globalisation homogenises economies. How much this specificity matters will vary, partly depending on that region\u2019s economy. But it matters more than is commonly assumed, and it matters in ways that are not generally recognised. Globalisation homogenises standards and management models. But it needs specialised economic capabilities.<\/p>\n<p>Establishing how a city\/region becomes a knowledge economy, requires highly detailed research. So let me use a case I have researched, the city of Chicago, to illustrate this. Chicago is usually seen as a latecomer to the knowledge economy \u2013 having started almost fifteen years later than in New York and London. The typical answer is that Chicago had to overcome its heavy agro-industrial past: its economic history is seen as a disadvantage compared to long-standing trading and financial centres such as New York and London.<\/p>\n<p>But I found that Chicago\u2019s past was not a disadvantage. It was one key source of its competitive advantage. This is most visible in the fact of its pre-eminence in the futures market built on pork bellies. The complexity, scale and international character of Chicago\u2019s historical agro-industrial economy required highly specialised financial, accounting and legal expertise. But these were, and still are, quite different from the expertise required to handle the sectors New York specialised in service exports, finance, and trade.<\/p>\n<p>It was Chicago\u2019s past as a massive agro-industrial complex that gave it some of its core and distinctive knowledge economy components. The city\u2019s economic history has made it the leading global futures financial centre and global provider of specialised services (accounting, legal, insurance, etc.) for handling heavy industry, heavy transport, agricultural.<\/p>\n<p>Chicago, S\u00e3o Paulo, Shanghai, Tokyo, and Seoul are among the leading producers of these types of specialised corporate services. That is not in spite of their economic past as major centres of heavy industry, but because of it.<\/p>\n<p>The state-of-the-art corporate built environment in global cities increasingly functions as infrastructure \u2013 it is necessary but indeterminate. This indeterminacy means that it is not enough to emphasise \u2018visual homogeneity\u2019 in the built environment, as is usually done. We need to understand how and for what it gets used. An office building today no longer simply signals \u2018office work\u2019 as it did up until the 1970s and even later. The specificity of the leading urban knowledge economies means that the particular contents they generate may vary enormously.<\/p>\n<p>A homogenised visual order today may actually house an enormous variety of knowledge economies. Its homogeneity arises from the fact that it is state-of-the-art. In turn, this means that homogeneity is a signalling system: \u2018I am equipped for any type of information economy\u2019. But what all cities share is the need for state-of-the-art built environments for work, home and consumption. The most common notion is that globalisation homogenises cities and their built environments, no matter how good the architecture. Today there is a new type of informal economy that is part of advanced capitalism. This in turn explains the particularly strong growth and dynamism of informal economies in global cities. It contributes to explain a mostly overlooked development: the proliferation of an informal economy of creative professional work in these cities, i.e. artists, architects, designers, software developers. The growth of this new informal economy is also happening in cities of the global south. In those cases, however, the new is often submerged under the older informal economy.<\/p>\n<p>The new types of informalisation of work are the low cost equivalent of formal deregulation. The latter has occurred in finance, telecommunications and most other economic sectors in the name of flexibility and innovation. The difference is that while formal deregulation was costly, and tax revenue as well as private capital went into paying for it, informalisation is low-cost. It is largely enacted on the backs of more vulnerable workers and their households.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":null,"article_publishing_date":"November 2007","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"2","name":"Saskia","created":"2011-08-24 17:21:14","modified":"2014-05-02 16:17:31","slug":"sassen-saskia","family_name":"Sassen","title":"","email_address":"","photo_legacy":"\/0_images\/02-SSassen.jpg","profile_text":"Saskia Sassen is the Robert S.

For instance, many sources including United Nations agencies and the Clinton Climate Initiative, state that cities account for 75 to 80 per cent of all greenhouse gases from human activities. But the actual figure seems to be around 40 per cent. Of the 60 per cent of emissions generated outside of cities, a large part comes from agriculture and deforestation, with much of the rest coming from heavy industry, fossil-fuelled power stations and wealthy high-consumption people who live in rural areas or urban centres too small to be classified as cities.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, many cities combine a good quality of life with relatively low levels of greenhouse gas emissions per person. There is no inherent conflict between an increasingly urbanised world and reduced global greenhouse gas emissions. Focusing on cities as \u2018the problem\u2019 often means that too much attention is paid to climate change mitigation (the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions), especially in low-income nations, and not enough on adaptation (minimising climate change\u2019s damaging impacts). Certainly, the planning, management and governance of cities should have a central role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions worldwide. But this should also have a central role in protecting populations from floods, storms, heat waves and other impacts that climate change will bring to many cities and this is an area that receives far too little attention.<br \/> The main source of greenhouse gas emissions in cities is energy use \u2013 in industrial production, transport and residential, commercial and government buildings (heating or cooling, lighting and appliances). Greenhouse gas emission inventories for cities show more than a tenfold difference in average per capita emissions between cities, with S\u00e3o Paulo having 1.5 tonnes of CO2 equivalent per person compared to 19.7 for Washington DC. The figure for Mexico City is 2.6 tonnes per person. If figures were available for more cities in low-income nations, the differences in per capita emissions between cities could well be more than hundred-fold. In most cities in low-income nations, greenhouse gas emissions per person cannot be high, simply because there is too little use of oil, coal and natural gas and little else to generate the other important greenhouse gases. There is little industry, very low levels of private car use, and limited ownership and use of electrical equipment in homes and businesses.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_55\" style=\"width: 406px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/08\/06_SA08Ref_Satterthwaite2.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-55\" title=\"06_SA08Ref_Satterthwaite2\" src=\"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/08\/06_SA08Ref_Satterthwaite2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"396\" height=\"274\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Over six million cars in the S\u00e3o Paulo Metropolitan Region contribute to choking levels of traffic congestion and air pollution. Of the Urban Age cities, car density \u2013 measured by the number of cars per km2 \u2013 is the highest in S\u00e3o Paulo (2,486)and Buenos Aires (6,281) compared to relatively low levels in Bogot\u00e1 (281).<\/p><\/div>\n<p align=\"justify\">Transport is an important contributor to greenhouse gas emissions in almost all cities, although its relative contribution varies a lot \u2013 for instance from around 11 per cent in Shanghai and Beijing in 1998 (in these cities industry is the largest generator of greenhouse gas emissions) to around 20 per cent for London, New York and Washington DC to 30-35 per cent for Rio de Janeiro, Barcelona and Toronto.<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Perhaps it is not cities in general that are the main source of greenhouse gas emissions, but only cities in high-income nations. However, an increasing number of studies of particular cities in Europe and North America show that they have much lower levels of greenhouse gas emissions compared to their national average \u2013 for instance New York and London have much lower emissions per person than the average for the USA or the UK. S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro also have much lower emissions per person than the average for Brazil.<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Of course, it is not cities (or small urban centres or rural areas) that are responsible for greenhouse gas emissions, but particular activities. An inventory of these activities can allocate these between cities, other urban centres and rural areas but this is not a simple exercise. For instance, the places with large coal-fired power stations would be very high greenhouse gas emitters, although most of the electricity they generate may be used elsewhere. This is why greenhouse gas emission inventories generally assign cities the emissions generated in providing the electricity consumed within their boundaries. This explains why some cities have surprisingly low per capita emissions, because the electricity they import does not come from fossil-fuelled power stations. For South American cities supplied with electricity mostly through hydropower, this would reduce their greenhouse gas emissions per person.<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">There are other difficulties. For instance, do the emissions from the petrol used by car-driving commuters get attributed to the city where they work, or to the suburb or rural area where they live? Which locations get assigned the carbon emissions from air travel? Total carbon emissions from any city with an international airport are much influenced by whether or not the city is assigned the fuel loaded onto the aircraft \u2013 even if most of the fuel is used in the air, outside the city. Total carbon emissions for cities such as S\u00e3o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro or New York are much influenced by whether or not these cities are assigned the fuel loaded onto aircraft at their airports.<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><img title=\"06_SA08Ref_Satterthwaite3\" src=\"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/08\/06_SA08Ref_Satterthwaite3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"396\" height=\"385\" \/>A more fundamental question is whether greenhouse gas emissions used in producing goods or services are allocated to production or consumption. If emissions are assigned to the final consumer\u2019s home, most emissions from agriculture, deforestation and industry could be assigned to cities where the industrial goods, wood products and food are consumed.<\/p>\n<p>Although where to assign greenhouse gas emissions might seem pedantic, it actually has enormous significance for how responsibilities for reducing greenhouse gas emissions are assigned between nations and within nations between cities and other settlements. If China\u2019s manufacturing cities are assigned all the greenhouse gas emissions that go into the goods exported (including the electricity that helped produce these goods), this would imply a much larger responsibility for these Chinese cities in moderating and eventually reversing such emissions than if these emissions were allocated to the nations or cities where Chinese exports are consumed. As Walker and King note: &#8216;Many of the countries in the western world have dodged their own carbon dioxide emissions by exporting their manufacturing to China. Next time you buy something with \u201cMade in China\u201d stamped on it, ask yourself who was responsible for the emissions that created it.\u2019<\/p>\n<p>Seeing cities as \u2018the problem\u2019 draws attention away from the fact that the driver of most greenhouse gas emissions is the consumption patterns of middle- and upper-income groups in wealthier nations. Using average figures for greenhouse gas emissions per person for cities hide the very large differences in emissions per person between high-income groups and low-income groups. High-income groups in the wealthiest Latin American cities are likely to have greenhouse gas emissions per person far higher than low-income groups. Focusing on cities only as large greenhouse gas emitters ascribes too much importance to energy efficiency within climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies for low-income nations, most of whose cities have very low fossil-fuel use (and thus far less scope for reducing it).<\/p>\n<p>Seeing cities as \u2018the problem\u2019 also misses the extent to which well-planned and governed cities are central to de-linking high living standards from high greenhouse gas emissions. This can be seen in part in the very large differentials between wealthy cities in petrol use per person; most US cities have three to five times the petrol use per person of most European cities, yet, they do not have a better quality of life.<\/p>\n<p>Cities with good public transport systems that have avoided low-density sprawl will generally have much lower levels of greenhouse gas emissions per person than cities that have not. Singapore has one-fifth of the car ownership per person compared to most cities in other high-income nations, yet also a higher income per person. Many of the most desirable (and expensive) residential areas in the world\u2019s wealthiest cities have high densities and building forms that can minimise the need for space heating and cooling \u2013 much more so than housing in suburban or rural areas. Most European cities have high-density centres where walking and cycling are preferred by much of the population \u2013 especially where good provisions are made for pedestrians and cyclists. High quality public transport can keep down private car ownership and use.<\/p>\n<p>Cities also concentrate so much of what contributes to a very high quality of life but which do not imply high material consumption levels (and thus high greenhouse gas emissions) \u2013 theatre, music, the visual arts, dance and the enjoyment of historic buildings and districts. Cities have also long been places of social, economic and political innovation. This is already evident in relation to global warming; in many high-income nations, city politicians have demonstrated a greater commitment to greenhouse gas emissions reduction than national politicians. This is evident in Latin America too, where much of the environmental and social innovation over the last 20 to 25 years has been driven by mayors. Many cities in Latin America, Africa and Asia have low greenhouse gas emissions per person. Yet they house hundreds of millions of people who are at risk from the increased frequency and\/or intensity of floods, storms and heat waves and water supply constraints that climate change is likely to bring. It is generally low-income groups that are most at risk \u2013 as they live in informal settlements, often on sites prone to flooding or landslides, lacking the drains and other needed protective infrastructure. Discussions of climate change priorities so often forget this. And these are risks that are not easily addressed, especially by international aid agencies that show little interest in urban areas and have little capacity to support the kinds of locally-driven pro-poor approaches that are needed.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"<p>This text is drawn from David Satterthwaite, \u2018Cities\u2019 contribution to global warming: notes on the allocation of greenhouse gas emissions\u2019, in Environment and Urbanization, Vol. 20, No. 2, pp 539-549.

But whether the building of cities is an act of great imagination or brutal disregard depends on a complex interplay of forces \u2013 political, ideological, social, economic, environmental.<\/p>\n<p>As an act of twenty-first-century city building, the 2012 Olympic Games in London created one of the largest urban regeneration projects in Europe, and \u2013 to my mind \u2013 one of the most imaginative. It offers a unique lens to take stock of the craft of city building. Many may be inclined to dismiss the London Olympics as being an exceptional event that holds few lessons for cities other than those wealthy enough to bid for hosting the Olympics. This would be a mistake. While mega-events are massively capitalised, singular events, it is precisely these unique circumstances of urban transformation on a grand scale and at hyper speed that allow us to observe the dynamic of city-building that would otherwise take decades to realise. How London used the Olympics to further its ambition for urban growth, and organised public and private resources and roles, institutional structures, masterplanning and design processes to align vision and action has applicability to a broad range of urban intervention as these are the ingredients, in one form or another, of urban transformation.<\/p>\n<p>In the current epoch of cities, during which hundreds of new, large-scale city-building enterprises will be required to absorb exploding rural-urban migration and population growth, our understanding of the city-building craft is an urgent matter. How we build cities not only has an immediate impact on the lives of millions of people who are and will become city dwellers, but the morphological legacy and settlement patterns that will be imprinted in the coming decades will have a profound effect on the ability of future generations to meet the challenge of global sustainability and resilience. The space between where ideas for city building are generated and their implementation through political, planning, financial, regulatory and institutional structures is often where there is a disjuncture between theory and practice, between urban visions and political realities, between what is planned versus what is actually built. It in this context that the London 2012 Games become instructive.<\/p>\n<h1>London 2012: an aspiration for city building<\/h1>\n<p>Despite some vociferous critics, the London 2012 Olympics have been acclaimed as a successful four-week celebration of sport, a spectacular show and a shining moment of British pride. But the more profound, lasting impact will be their role in shifting the trajectory of London\u2019s growth. The regeneration of a 600-acre (243-hectare) brownfield site will join the history of London\u2019s totemic moments of city-building where its pattern of growth was irrevocably transformed. The Olympics have been focused in East London, one of the historically most deprived areas of the city where surveys of urban distress from the late-nineteenth century \u2013 the famous Booth Poverty Maps of 1898\u201399 \u2013 are largely unchanged a century later; an area of the city that has suffered the familiar saga of urban deterioration resulting from de-industrialisation, concentrated poverty, and the destruction of the urban fabric through the de-urbanising forces of urban renewal.<\/p>\n<p>Against this backdrop, the 2012 Olympics were merely an actor \u2013 albeit a transformative one \u2013 in a larger urban narrative the origins of which lie in the last four decades of vision, policy, and tenacity to reverse this declining condition. Through the vicissitudes of markets, politics and changing ideas of urban planning and \u2018good urban form\u2019 there has been a determination that for London to successfully grow it must \u2018move East\u2019. With vast areas of lower-value land sitting only minutes from central London, its potential cried out to be unlocked through the building of infrastructure and the assembly of land.<\/p>\n<p>The term \u2018legacy\u2019, often posited as a post-hoc rationalisation to justify massive investment in sports facilities and infrastructure, was just the opposite in London\u2019s case. Here, the Olympics were the tangible manifestation of a clear vision for urban transformation in search of a means to be realised. Vision, politics, urban ideas, economic realities and the land constraints of a global city colluded to produce the Olympic Park in East London.<\/p>\n<p>While not a scientific accounting, a cartoon version tracing key moments in the lineage of the Olympic Park might go something like this:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The 1947 Town and Country Act and the Abercrombie Plan established a Green Belt that circumscribed London\u2019s expansion, forcing inward regeneration when London grows;<\/li>\n<li>The development of the Docklands and Canary Wharf throughout the 1980s and 1990s, re-positioned obsolete East London waterfront lands as a new financial centre to secure London\u2019s competitive economic position in Europe and globally;<\/li>\n<li>The Urban Task Force, a government study chaired by Lord Richard Rogers in the late 1990s, which advocated for compact urban form, building on brownfield land near good public transport hubs and the value of urban regeneration, especially along the river Thames;<\/li>\n<li>The election of Ken Livingstone in 2000 as the first elected Mayor of London represented the beginning of a devolution of power to London that has been strengthened during the mayoralty of current Mayor Boris Johnson. Both supported the regeneration of East London as their highest priority for urban reinvestment, representing a critical continuity of vision and commitment.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The development and consent for the Stratford Master Plan, spearheaded by visionary developers Stuart Lipton and Nigel Hugill in 2004, before the bid was even won, signalled the potential of this part of East London for major investment from the private and public sector, an area ripe for regeneration.<\/p>\n<p>The salient point is that the decision to build London\u2019s Olympic Park in the East London community of Stratford was taken in the larger context of London\u2019s plan for growth and was a deliberate strategy to rebuild the fabric of a city that had been ruptured. Building a new, compact piece of urbanism on a brownfield site connected to a dense network of upgraded transport infrastructure, with the ambition to integrate it physically, economically and socially with the adjacent communities may seem obvious, but that is not the case in too many new cities that are being built and rebuilt in the rapidly urbanising world.<\/p>\n<h1>How was it achieved?<\/h1>\n<p>When London was awarded the Olympics in 2005, among the first priorities was to acquire the 600-acre (243-hectare) future site of the Olympic Park. At the time it was largely blighted industrial and derelict land, some of which had in fact been used as the dumping ground for debris from the devastation East London suffered from bombings in World War II. Sitting on top of a dense transport network, the regeneration potential of the area was stymied by the hundreds of disparate freehold interests that needed to be assembled to unlock the latent opportunity. The Olympics provided the political will and capital to undertake the task that had previously been seen as too difficult.<\/p>\n<p>Concomitant with organising the land was the need to establish the institutional architecture to deliver the Olympic Park, both for Games and for their legacy. This seemingly mundane matter would be the unsung hero of the success of the Olympics. The alignment of national, metropolitan (mayoral) and local political interests, and the creation of well-designed, focused delivery structures, was critical to get right from the outset of the project. And there was no time to waste with an immovable deadline looming large for the opening ceremony of the Olympics. Multiple central government ministries, national sports bodies, the Mayor of London, the four local \u2018host boroughs\u2019 that owned land or were adjacent to the Olympic Park, and the diverse communities of East London all had to be engaged and, most dauntingly, aligned.<\/p>\n<p>While a vast network of governance and consultation structures were established to coordinate the Olympics enterprise \u2013 from the highest level Cabinet Committee chaired by the Prime Minister to local community organisations throughout East London \u2013 three principal delivery vehicles were created to deliver the Games:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA): the infrastructure company focused on the building of the Park and off-site venues. A time-limited organisation with a board of private and public representatives which received the bulk of public funding from central government and the mayor to deliver the facilities for the Games;<\/li>\n<li>The London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (LOCOG): the organisation charged with staging the Olympic events, securing sponsors and liaising with the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and other national and international sports bodies;<\/li>\n<li>The Olympic Park Legacy Company (OPLC), later renamed the London Legacy Development Corporation (LLDC): master developer and landowner of the Olympic Park, focused on the post-Games transformation from event mode to regeneration and attracting investment in the land and venues.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The creation of the OPLC in 2009 (of which the author was its first Chief Executive, eds.) fully three years before the Games, was novel for an Olympic host city and testament to the core regeneration purpose of the Olympics investment. A company jointly owned by the Mayor of London and the national government, and including the representation on its board of the two principal boroughs owning land in the Park \u2013 the London boroughs of Hackney and Newham \u2013 this unique creation was designed to reflect the delicate balancing of interests and power that needed to be aligned to deliver successful regeneration.<\/p>\n<p>This division of labour among the three entities did not of course recuse the other delivery entities from incorporating legacy considerations into the core of their programme, as this mission was embodied in the ethos of the Olympics enterprise in London. However, the OPLC, with a singular focus on the post-Games agenda of city building was critical to setting and overseeing that vision and ensuring that actions were taken to deliver physical, social and economic regeneration of the Olympic Park, spreading its benefits to surrounding communities. In this way, there could be as seamless as possible integration between the Games and post-Games use of infrastructure, land, buildings and venues.<\/p>\n<p>Crucial to the city-building task was the development of the masterplan that would establish the framework for the GB\u00a36 billion government infrastructure investment to be expended on the site. And key to this were three integrated but distinct phases: the Games Plan, the Transformation Plan (for the transition from Games upon completion) and the Legacy Communities Plan (the long-term plan for the build-out of the site). The strength of London\u2019s approach was to conceive these three plans in exact opposite chronology; that is, planning for the site started from the long view of a vision for the future city and then worked back to the requirements of the Games. The starting point was the vision for the future. And this basic premise has profound ramifications for all that was to be planned and built, the main features of which included:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The creation of a central park of over 200 acres (81 hectares) along the River Lea (following the removal of electricity pylons) that formed the central spine of the site and created the armature around which five future neighbourhoods would be built, very much in keeping with London precedents for the integration of urban parks and built-up areas, such as Victoria Park and Regents Park;<\/li>\n<li>The building of only those venues that were needed on a permanent basis and would have future uses and constituencies, all other venues would be interim facilities that would be removed to create the sites for the future mixed-use area with homes, schools, shops and places of work;<\/li>\n<li>Dispersing the venues throughout the site in strategic locations rather than clustering all the facilities in the usual \u2018sports zone\u2019. In this way the sports venues could become anchors of activity and physical icons integrated with the new neighbourhoods;<\/li>\n<li>The Olympic Athletes Village, which during Games would host 17,000 athletes, staff and residents, was built to be transformed into the first complete post-Games complex of 3,000 units of housing;<\/li>\n<li>GB\u00a31 billion invested in upgrading existing rail and bus lines serving the site, including the building of a new international transport centre to accommodate future connections to Europe and immediate connections to London\u2019s major transport hub of Kings Cross, which makes central London only a five-minute ride and one-stop away;<\/li>\n<li>A central energy centre was built with sufficient capacity to service the entire site in legacy as well as having the potential to export energy to surrounding communities;<\/li>\n<li>An underground network of new sewers, utilities, and telecommunications ducts was built to accommodate future capacity needs.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>These basic and interrelated building blocks of the masterplan, and the investment it guided, resulted in about 75 per cent of the total Olympics budget being spent to create a <em>platform for the future city<\/em>. While distinctive buildings were certainly constructed, such as Zaha Hadid\u2019s Aquatics Centre and Hopkins Architects\u2019 Velodrome, the main focus of investment was putting in place the prerequisites of a new piece of London.<\/p>\n<p>And this intensity of focus on legacy did not end with the Games: institutions, funding, commercial transactions and community partnerships were established to ensure a smooth transition from an Olympic Park for Games to its post-Games urban life. Importantly, both commercially and symbolically, all of the permanent sports venues have secured future uses, thus removing the fear of \u2018white elephants\u2019 that had plagued so many mega-event cities and stymied their future development by standing vacant. The unfolding transition also included:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>A masterplan and design guidelines that establish the framework (adopted and approved by the planning authority) for the future development of 8,000 new homes and creating certainty required for private sector investment and community confidence;<\/li>\n<li>An additional GB\u00a3500 million of funding from central government was dedicated to the post-Games transformation of the Park to retrofit venues, prepare sites and build open spaces and amenities;<\/li>\n<li>The Athletes Village\u2019s 3,000 units were sold for a mixed-income community, half for affordable housing and half to a private developer for what is now being marketed as London\u2019s newest \u2018cool\u2019 residential neighbourhood, East Village;<\/li>\n<li>The International Broadcast Centre (IBC) and Media Centre, two buildings that together comprise over 100,000 square metres of space and the length of 7 jumbo jets, are being transformed into a new technology hub \u2013 iCity \u2013 to house British Telecommunications sports studios, a research and teaching centre for Loughborough University, a data centre and an accelerator space for start-ups.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To oversee and manage this complex interweaving of city-building activities, and the choreography of public and private investment and actions that need to be carefully staged, the OPLC was re-engineered and given powers to ensure that the integration of planning and implementation, that proved so essential in the success of the delivery of the Games, was carried through in legacy.<\/p>\n<p>Through national legislation enabling the mayor to create local development corporations, very much a modern version of the government development corporation in the 1970s that spearheaded the first generation of East London\u2019s transformation in the Docklands, OPLC was reconstituted as the London Legacy Development Corporation (LLDC) under the Mayor of London\u2019s control. It was given not only ownership of the Olympic Park land, but also the planning authority for the Olympic Park and surrounding neighbourhoods under the jurisdiction of local boroughs. This exceptional consolidation of land ownership and planning power, unthinkable in most Western cities too timid to assert such power since the mass urban renewal of the post-World War II era, was agreed to by all levels of national and local government with a common purpose to maintain the regeneration momentum fuelled by the Games. What will be surprising to observers of urban development is that there was virtually no community opposition to the creation of the LLDC and its extraordinary powers.<\/p>\n<h1>The Convergence Agenda<\/h1>\n<p>London is spatially and socio-economically unequal: it has an affluent West and a more deprived East. Life expectancy drops from 80 years to 73 years as you move eastwards across the city. This dramatic statistic captures the disparity in many social and economic indicators between East London and the rest of the city. The Olympic \u2018host\u2019 boroughs have historically been among the worse off in England. To counteract this grim reality and leverage investment for the Games, local mayors developed the concept of <em>convergence<\/em> as they key driver for change amongst their communities. <em>Convergence<\/em> establishes an aspiration that East Londoners\u2019 life chances and opportunities should, at a minimum, be on a par with the average of all of London. Far from being modest, this simple aspiration established bold and comprehensive goals in improving employment, health, education, housing conditions and all the indices of life chances and circumstances that would help ensure that the conditions documented by Booth\u2019s Survey a century ago were ameliorated beyond the artificial confines of the Park. And, importantly, it recognised that for genuine regeneration to occur beyond the traditional \u2018bricks and mortar\u2019 of the Park, there had to be a more comprehensive programme of investment and change.<\/p>\n<p>Translating the Convergence Policy to the Olympic Park was as much of a mindset as it was a legislative matter. Every piece of the building of a new piece of city needed to be understood as an asset through which mixture and diversity are promoted. Too often this perspective is compartmentalised as a separate \u2018programme\u2019, as opposed to being a core part of everything that is delivered. To address this, the OPLC adopted an inter-related set of policies to promote <em>convergence<\/em>, such as:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Requiring affordable housing (35 per cent of all new housing built on the Park);<\/li>\n<li>Proactively creating local employment and small business opportunities generated by the venues, such as the Aquatics Centre, so that they are operated by small business enterprises;<\/li>\n<li>Setting affordable rates for the sports venues for local residents so that the poorest of residents could swim in world-class facilities or attend a football game in the Olympic Stadium;<\/li>\n<li>Using the International Press, Media Broadcast Centre facilities as a resource to diversify the economy of East London by actively creating a technology hub and connecting this to local community colleges and training for opportunities in the new economy;<\/li>\n<li>Creating community programming for future activities in the Olympic Park so that the Park would be first and foremost a park enjoyed by local communities, and not solely for tourists;<\/li>\n<li>Working with Westfield, the largest urban shopping centre operator in Europe, to support of a \u2018retail academy\u2019 to train local residents for service jobs, which has resulted in the majority of positions being filled locally;<\/li>\n<li>Constructing bridges to connect the Park over canals, roads and railways that divide the site from adjacent communities.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Ultimately, the London Legacy Corporation has significantly been able to extend its remit beyond the Olympic Park itself, to ensure the integration of the Park with surrounding communities. On reflection, the role of the agency has been to bridge between vision and action, ideas and institutions, and the integration of the physical, social and economic aspects of diversity and mixture essential to realise successful urbanism. In this case, without the Convergence Agenda the Park could easily become an elite island unto itself, rather than part of an integrated whole: a new piece of London.<\/p>\n<h1>What does this mean for Rio 2016?<\/h1>\n<p>Imaginative city building, and the marshalling of forces necessary to achieve it, is a complex task that too often occurs in silos. The London Olympics story may sound too perfect in attempting to rectify that divide and create the platform to connect imagination with the fine grain of urban form. Time will be the ultimate judge as to whether the foundation will work. Affordable housing and employment policies to ensure diversity could be eroded; design guidelines intended to ensure diversity in the built environment could be discarded at the behest of capital; land could be sold too quickly, in too large swathes for revenue which would obstruct a more diverse city created by many hands over time; the institutions created to steward this precious asset could be prevented from taking the longer view. And, of course, we will look back at today\u2019s statistics of the fortunes of East London to measure whether they have genuinely \u2018converged\u2019 or deprivation has simply been pushed further out of sight.<\/p>\n<p>For Rio de Janeiro, as it is mobilises to deliver its legacy of the 2016 Games, the questions of how the investments will lead to greater integration or further segregation of the city are paramount. Will Porto Maravilha evolve to reflect the dynamism of Rio\u2019s urbanism, its lively streets, mix of uses and pedestrian-oriented street culture, and not simply become a platform for capital? Will the new, important investments in transport help to heal the North-South divide or serve to further greater sprawl? Will the recent investment in the <em>favelas<\/em> lead not only to improved conditions but greater economic and social integration with the dynamics of Rio\u2019s growth?<\/p>\n<p>Hopefully, London\u2019s recent experience offers insights for debate.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":"","article_publishing_date":"October 2013","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"168","name":"Andrew","created":"2011-12-15 00:38:55","modified":"2014-01-10 12:10:37","slug":"altman-andrew","family_name":"Altman","title":"","email_address":"","photo_legacy":"","profile_text":"Andy Altman is a\u00a0Visiting Senior Fellow at LSE Cities and former Chief Executive, London Legacy Development Corporation 2009-2012.","organization":"LSE Cities","role":"Visiting Senior Fellow","additional_affiliations":"","qualifications":"","staff_pages_blurb":"Andrew Altman is a\u00a0Visiting Senior Fellow at LSE Cities.

While the roots of this narrative go back to the \u2018shy modernity\u2019 period from the second half of the nineteenth century to the proclamation of the Republic, the focus will be on three phases of political transition in Turkey: the period of \u2018radical modernity\u2019 from 1923 to 1950; the period of \u2018populist modernity\u2019 from 1950 to 1980; and the \u2018erosion of modernity\u2019 which has occurred since the 1980s.<\/p>\n<p>World War I saw the disintegration of the Ottoman Empire into nation-states. The proclamation of a Turkish Republic in 1923 involved both continuity and rupture from certain aspects of the past. The challenge was to transform a pre-industrial empire into a state that represented \u2018radical modernity\u2019 and liberated citizens from the constraints of the Ottoman Empire by placing trust in science and technology. The leaders of the Republic implemented institutional reforms that did not, however, adhere to a consistent or comprehensive political theory; instead they conceived the construction of a nation as a socio-spatial process defined by four clear strategies.<\/p>\n<p>The first was the proclamation of Ankara as the capital city of a republic founded on the belief that a sense of national unity could not be developed within the cosmopolitan atmosphere of large port cities. It was hoped that an emerging middle class could establish new standards and values which would serve as an example for the whole country. In doing so, the success of Ankara as a modern capital became linked to the fate of a new political regime.<\/p>\n<p>The second strategy was the construction of a railroad system to integrate the Turkish internal market. During the period of \u2018shy modernity\u2019, railroad construction had been carried out by foreign companies charged with connecting rural areas to port cities. This opened up more land to colonial powers, however, and resulted in the disintegration of the internal market instead of its integration. The new Republic\u2019s administration was determined to implement an integrated rail network and thus doubled its size and, more importantly, converted the existing tree-like system based on port cities to a hub-and-spoke network, with Ankara at its hub.<\/p>\n<p>The third strategy was the development of a government-sponsored industrialisation programme aimed at reducing imports of foreign goods through construction of factories in small towns along the rail network. It was expected that these three strategies of \u2018radical modernity\u2019 taken together with a fourth to build public houses (halkevleri) in most cities across the country would penetrate all of Turkey from these focal points.<\/p>\n<p>When Ankara was made the capital, Istanbul lost all administrative functions and the jobs that went with it. Although Istanbul maintained its position as Turkey&#8217;s largest city, Izmir was overtaken by Ankara, which soon became the second-largest city.<\/p>\n<p>Like many developing countries, Turkey faced rapid urbanisation following World War II with Ankara and most other cities experiencing six per cent annual growth rates. During this period of \u2018populist modernity\u2019 there was also a shift to formal employment opportunities, housing, and infrastructure to accommodate the growing urban population. But provision of these elements depended on a high rate of capital accumulation which did not yet exist. Another key challenge was that the education and skills of rural migrants were insufficient to sustain them in the city. Finally, rapid population growth increased land speculation, raising prices beyond the means of middle-income groups and expanding cities beyond their municipal boundaries. During these early years of rapid urbanisation, Turkey also moved from a single-party regime to a multi-party democracy \u2013 one in which populist tendencies increased and patron-client relations became dominant. This all coincided with an industrialisation programme that increased the demand for cheap labour in cities.<\/p>\n<p>Although the urban middle classes, which included professional planners, supported implementation of the modernist legitimacy framework, in the face of rapid urbanisation, initially these groups insisted on sending migrants back to their villages. As incoming migration reached levels where such measures would be absurd, the middle class \u2018imprisoned\u2019 these new urban citizens in their minds as \u2018peasants in the citys\u2019. It was expected that with time, these migrants would learn to live within the modernist legitimacy models. This expectation, however, runs contrary to premises of acculturation theory. These groups expected that in the case of two cultures coming face to face, one would be transformed into the other. Such an expectation may have removed the need to search for a new legitimisation alternative.<\/p>\n<p>In order to understand Turkey\u2019s urban development in this era, it is necessary to consider the ways in which the central government\u2019s planning ideology was undermined by the spontaneous actions of these new migrants as well as the middle classes. Planning ideology entailed implementation of a plan prepared with scientific methods. This plan of the city\u2019s future would be announced to society and was meant to avoid development activities presented as a fait accompli. This would apply at the scale of individual buildings, for example by requiring formal permits for construction and for occupancy. It also involved establishing the Ministry of Construction and Resettlement (\u0130mar ve \u0130skan Bakanl\u0131\u011f\u0131), which functioned like a ministry of urbanisation. During this period laws were passed to protect the historical urban fabric and urban planning education was institutionalised. Metropolitan planning offices were also established in each of the three cities to help them comply with a key requirement from the Provincial Bank (\u0130ller Bankas\u0131): in order to secure funding for urban infrastructure, applicants needed to provide a city plan.<\/p>\n<p>The first serious impact of rapid urbanisation was a shortage of housing, and two types of spontaneous solutions were developed to overcome this problem. Government regulations did not offer the multitudes that had left rural areas the chance to sustain their lives, and soon the cities were encircled by the informal gecekondu settlements. Recognising the need for new housing, the populist democratic regime was tolerant of this phenomenon, especially when compared to dictatorships. It is for this reason that the gecekondu neighbourhoods of Turkey have always been superior in quality and appearance to their Latin-American counterparts.<\/p>\n<p>In order to reconcile this informality with the planning regulations born from the modernist legitimacy framework, the government passed a series of amnesty laws which retroactively legitimised some of the illegal gecekondu settlements. Yet the building of new gecekondus continued. In time, they would become partially integrated with the formal housing market until finally it became impossible for new migrants to build gecekondus. This was because land was controlled by radical political groups which provided gecekondus in exchange for political loyalty.<\/p>\n<p>The second response to provide spontaneous housing entailed a \u2018build-and-sell\u2019 (yapsat\u00e7\u0131) strategy. It was developed by the middle classes who also faced a housing shortage when rapidly rising land prices eliminated the practice of registering a single building on a single parcel of land in a single name. The \u2018build-and-sell\u2019 solution enabled the middle classes to share the cost of a single parcel of land through fragmentation of ownership. It grew out of a process by which small-scale developers would acquire land from landowners in exchange for a selected number of apartment units in the multistory housing to be built on the land. The units remaining after the allocation to landowners were put on the market; not surprisingly, values were the highest in older parts of the city. This led to the formation of residential areas with inadequate infrastructure and densities far higher than those foreseen in plans. As it was easier to present this spontaneous development as congruent with modernist legitimacy models compared to gecekondus, the government put forward a law allowing for the registration of a building in more than one name, including rules organising the management of apartment buildings. With new development plans increasing the number of stories in the three big cities, building densities were increased, so \u2018build-and-sell\u2019 housing seemingly remained consonant with modernist legitimacy models.<\/p>\n<p>Another spontaneous development was the dolmu\u015f. Municipalities were unable to expand public transport to meet this increased demand and the dolmu\u015f \u2013 a privately operated shared taxi service provided by small-scale entrepreneurs whereby old taxis were modified to accommodate more passengers \u2013 filled the gap. Since the dolmu\u015f fares were shared, they were affordable to middle- and low-income riders. As local administrations could not hinder development of the dolmu\u015f since the supply of public transport was inadequate, instead they organised the dolmu\u015f system along particular lines in the city.<\/p>\n<p>Such emergent solutions resulted in the three largest cities displaying similar growth patterns: expansion of the city along intercity motorways, high-density inner-city development, and growth of the central business district toward high-income neighbourhoods. In this model of growth, provision of social services in the high-density city centre remained inadequate, green areas were overtaken by development, traffic congestion increased, and cities began losing their identities as the historical urban fabric was replaced by \u2018build-and-sell\u2019 apartment blocks. Gecekondu settlements were also encircling these cities. The populations of the three big cities increased greatly, making Istanbul, Ankara, and Izmir metropolitan cities. But cities that grow in this way do not possess the structural characteristics of metropolises of industrial economies; it is perhaps thus more appropriate to call them overgrown industrial cities.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_733\" style=\"width: 769px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-733\" title=\"07_01\" src=\"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/11\/07_01.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"759\" height=\"378\" \/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Hali\u00e7 (the Golden Horn) lost its significance as a harbour, port and shipyard under changing political structures, but remains a major cultural and historical site.<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Confronted with this situation, attempts to sustain the modernist legitimisation framework could have included new planning approaches since planning was considered a legitimate political solution at the time. Implementation of partial development plans by local actors, however, challenged this framework. Large-scale developers with significant capital had also not yet appeared. Instead, development of large sites was carried out by a myriad of small-scale projects. These were undertaken by private real estate interests functioning as a fait accompli mechanism undermining urban development plans. The small-scale capital owners who took part in these partial development plans often made use of political channels within the context of populism while powerful political actors seeking prestige through large scale projects also undermined urban planning.<\/p>\n<p>In executing these \u2018development operations\u2019, priority was given to solving everyday problems of the people even if it meant sidestepping planning oversight or the rule of law. These large-scale development operations occurred only in Istanbul \u2013 for example the Bosporus Bridge and beltway project in 1967-73 by Prime Minister S\u00fcleyman Demirel \u2013 but they could not be sustained for long periods of time, and were typically abandoned within four or five years given growing resistance within professional circles.<\/p>\n<p>Beginning in 1980, a new and open development policy oriented towards exports would define the Turkish economy. As state entrepreneurship waned, priority was given to the private sector. This transformation brought about a radical change in how Turkey established relations with the rest of the world. About ten years later, the disintegration of the socialist block and the end of the Cold War also provided important opportunities for Turkey to open its economy. Most important of all was the worldwide transformation following the economic crisis of 1970. This transition from industrialisation to a knowledge-based economy \u2013 from the Fordist type of production organisation to a more flexible type and from the world of nation-states to a globalised world \u2013 constituted the main dimensions of this transformation from modernism to postmodernism.<\/p>\n<p>Istanbul began to regain functions it had lost in the 1920s after the Soviet and Turkish revolutions. These transformations would give Istanbul the status of a global city alongside the megacities of the world, although at the time urban planning circles in Turkey preferred to apply the concept of \u2018world city\u2019.<\/p>\n<p>After 1980, the processes determining the structure and expansion of Turkish cities also underwent an important change: instead of growing through the addition of individual buildings and decisions by individuals or small-scale developers, cities were being transformed by the actions of large organisations and powerful actors. Cities could now grow by the addition of large built-up areas through institutional arrangements and new building-supply methods. The most important of these was a mass housing model derived from the \u2018build-and-sell\u2019 method. Mass building was not reserved for residential development but was applied to business needs as well. This included industrial zones and sites for warehouses, wholesale trade centres, transport services, specialised production and free trade zones. In each, small-scale developers or even individuals were organised into cooperatives or other institutional bodies to realise such large-scale operations.<\/p>\n<p>The creation of new self-contained business centres with all the necessary facilities and infrastructure undermined the role of the historical central business districts.The most prominent example was seen in Istanbul, where the old city centres of Emin\u00f6n\u00fc and Beyo\u00f0lu could not meet the new control and management requirements. In constructing the new central business district of skyscrapers located along the Mecidiyek\u00f6y and Maslak axes at the western ridges of the Bosporus, access was provided to high-income residential areas in the North thanks to Istanbul\u2019s new found capacity to mobilise large amounts of capital.<\/p>\n<p>During this period of growth, Turkey\u2019s three main cities did not rely exclusively on a pattern of expansion to new areas; important transformations were also taking place in the old urban zones. Three key factors determined this transformation.The first was the new development dynamics that transformed Istanbul and, to a lesser extent, Ankara and Izmir, from overgrown industrial cities to city-regions. This transformation prompted important functional changes in the city centres. For example, although Emin\u00f6n\u00fc, the city\u2019s oldest centre of business, lost several of its production and service functions, it gained important touristic and cultural roles. A similar process has taken place in Beyo\u011flu.<\/p>\n<p>A second change took place in the provision of transport infrastructure whereby all three cities borrowed large amounts of capital to realise public transportation projects. This led to gentrification of some neighbourhoods near the city centre, as in the cases of Cihangir and Kuzguncuk. The third factor was environmental and attempted to address the risks from earthquakes. For example, recently there has been increased pressure to upgrade the poor construction of older gecekondu and other substandard buildings.<\/p>\n<p>But what to make of the modernist legitimacy in these cities? As their development extends further into the periphery and central districts continue to be transformed, unauthorised construction is no longer specific only to gecekondu housing. Informal construction is increasing, even in the wealthier parts of Istanbul. Thus instead of gecekondu settlements becoming more in tune with the framework of modernist legitimacy models, the reverse is happening.<\/p>\n<p>This is a natural consequence of a growth trajectory which adds large built-up areas en masse to a city\u2019s existing fabric. Although it is possible to control and plan for a city\u2019s future expansion, the best way of doing so is through incremental growth. In Turkey, development is controlled by powerful actors who do not mind paying the high costs involved. Thus a fait accompli occurs the moment a large parcel of land is bought.<\/p>\n<p>Developed democracies have realised that it is no longer possible to control urban development using modernist plans representing a city frozen in time; instead strategic plans prepared through public participation and a deliberative, democratic process direct a city\u2019s growth. Implementation of plans in Turkey, however, should not be confused with the transparent processes of developed democracies. In Turkey, a mayor\u2019s use of authority is not always transparent. Meanwhile, the demands on behalf of civic groups for increased municipal authority in the name of national decentralisation and participatory democracy have at times exacerbated this misuse of discretionary powers. This is because Turkey\u2019s city administrations have not been completely democratised yet, and strong municipal authority has created, in most cases, local fiefdoms rather than widespread civic engagement.<\/p>\n<p>Like the lifespan of a human being, this urban narrative covers 80 years of development of Turkey\u2019s three largest cities \u2013 it is a story of modernisation, democratisation, and urbanisation that has taken place in a far shorter time and with a less efficient form of capital accumulation than one finds in other European cities.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"<p>Essay adapted from \u2018An Exploratory Approach to Urban Historiography through a New Paradigm: The Case of Turkey\u2019 included in a forthcoming publication, The Turkish Triangle: Ankara, Istanbul, and Izmir at the Gates of Europe, by Harvard University Press.<\/p>\n","pdf_uri":"http:\/\/v0.urban-age.net\/publications\/newspapers\/istanbul\/articles\/07_IlhanTekeli\/en_GB\/07_IlhanTekeli_en.pdf","article_publishing_date":"November 2009","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"25","name":"Ilhan","created":"2011-10-04 13:37:35","modified":"2011-10-04 14:37:35","slug":null,"family_name":"Tekeli","title":null,"email_address":null,"photo_legacy":null,"profile_text":"","organization":"","role":"","additional_affiliations":null,"qualifications":null,"staff_pages_blurb":null,"office_location":null,"display_after":null,"display_until":null,"extended_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb_lang2":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation_lang2":null,"phone_number":null}],"attachments":false,"gallery":{"slug":false,"extra_classes":"","slides":[]}},{"request_language":"","current_page_uri":"\/media\/search-dev.json","lang2_slug":false,"lang2_name":false,"parent_publication_id":11,"featured_image_uri":"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/11\/04_00.jpeg","article_title":"City Making as Climate Policy","permalink":"city-making-as-climate-policy","article_subtitle":"","article_abstract":"<p>With cities contributing disproportionally to global carbon emissions, Philipp Rode describes how focusing on the core qualities of the compact city is the key to fighting climate change.<\/p>\n","article_summary":"","article_text":"<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>In 1986, one of the editions of the German news weekly Der Spiegel depicted a severe warning on its cover: Cologne\u2019s famous gothic cathedral was shown half submerged in an endless sea of water with not a single other building visible. The issue was titled \u2018the climate catastrophe\u2019 and linked the global environmental crisis not only to the great aspirations of mankind \u2013 Cologne\u2019s cathedral was the tallest structure in the world in 1880 \u2013 but also to the disappearance of a city, exposing its vulnerability to the forces of nature.<\/p>\n<p>The cover was of course an exaggeration at a time when the public knew little about carbon emissions, climate change and rising sea levels. Yet it was in the mid-1980s that humanity\u2019s ecological footprint surpassed the earth\u2019s capacity. Since then, our massive ecological debt has continued to increase. Despite the establishment of the Kyoto Protocol in 1997, global carbon emissions have shot up by another 26 per cent and the global sea level is now expected to rise up to one metre by 2100.<\/p>\n<p>We now know that cities and climate change are inextricably linked. The widespread acknowledgement of the risks associated with global warming and the need for urgent global action coincides with the global shift from a rural to an urban global population. Cities are vulnerable to a range of effects, of which the rise of sea levels, freak weather conditions and water shortages are among the most prominent. The United Nations estimates that no less than 400 million urban dwellers are exposed to risks associated with sea level rise. But although urbanisation brings a disproportionate hunger for development and consumption of the planet\u2019s scarce natural resources, well designed cities can offer a viable answer to the search for more sustainable lifestyles.<\/p>\n<p>Urbanisation is accompanied by excessive material consumption, more energy-intensive food supplies and ever-increasing flows of goods and people. Between 1950 and 2005, the urban population grew globally from 29 to 49 per cent, while global carbon emissions jumped from 1,630 to 7,985 million tonnes. It is now frequently stated that cities emit around 75 per cent of all carbon emissions. Some cities emit so much that they rank among entire countries, as is the case with Shanghai, which would place 25th in a global ranking of carbon output per country. While such statistics fail to recognise the complexity of linking emissions to a specific territory, they also mask how locally produced, exported and indirect carbon emissions are differentiated. It is true that most statements about city specific carbon production fail to recognise the complexity of assigning emissions to specific territories and how to differentiate locally produced, exported and indirect carbon. However, most estimates suggest that cities are responsible for a disproportionately higher share of global carbon output. Indirect emissions can have a particularly strong impact: for example when including the emission from air travel to and from London, aviation is the city\u2019s largest single source of carbon emissions, calculated at approximately 34 per cent.<\/p>\n<p>About two-thirds of global greenhouse gas emissions are energy related, of which the top two sources, heating and electricity for buildings comprise 25 per cent, while transport and industry are responsible for 22 per cent each. By comparison, emissions from buildings in high-income cities typically account for 60 per cent, and transport for 30 per cent. It is transport emissions that are particularly worrying. Even within the European Union and its ambitious carbon reduction policy, transport-related carbon emissions have increased by a staggering 36 per cent between 1990 and 2006 while other key sectors have at least achieved modest reductions.<\/p>\n<p>What is worse, carbon emissions from transport are increasing more rapidly in the world\u2019s fastest growing metropolitan areas. This is partly because some cities are pursuing conventional models of modernisation, creating an infrastructure legacy matching those of the cheap oil period of the 1950s and 1960s. This politics of concrete and steel, celebrating urban motorways, flyovers and tunnels not only ignore the vast evidence that road construction leads to more traffic and longer travel distances rather than a reduction in congestion, but they can eventually result in the destruction of the city itself. According to empirical estimates for metropolitan areas in the United States, each new highway penetrating the urban core has led to a decline of central city residents by 18 per cent. Metropolitan regions that once embraced the automobile have become endless cities with cars demanding more space than ever before. Today, the S\u00e3o Paulo metropolitan region has more than 6 million cars, an amount that supersedes the total amount of cars in India in 2005; at the same time, the overlooked city centre, with its direct access and public transport links, has been abandoned by most middle-class residents and the city\u2019s leading corporations.<\/p>\n<p>In cities, high standards of living do not necessarily entail consumption of an equally high level of natural resources. At their most basic level, cities follow the logic of any larger organism: they consume less energy per unit than smaller ones. By concentrating people, processes and interactions, cities not only vastly increase social and economic opportunities but, up to a certain size, they benefit from the economy of scale in infrastructure and can optimise the efficiency of a broad range of services. A recent comparison of German cities has shown that on average, the amount of road surfaces or the length of electric cables increase only by 80 to 90 per cent when the population doubles, instead of the expected 100 per cent.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_728\" style=\"width: 1155px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-728\" title=\"04_01\" src=\"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/11\/04_01.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1145\" height=\"480\" \/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">New York City\u2019s \u2019Green Light for Midtown\u2019 is changing the way the city views its streets. These images of Herald Square show mixed-use pedestrian and cycle ways contributing to green transport corridors.<\/p><\/div>\n<p>This translates into a better environmental performance of cities compared to their regional context: New York City produces only 1 per cent of the country\u2019s overall greenhouse gases, but is home to 3.7 per cent of its population. Even when considering all indirect and embedded carbon emissions, urban living outperforms suburban and rural lifestyles in rich nations, as the Stockholm Environment Institute has recently shown for the United Kingdom. There are also enormous differences between cities: most cities in the United States have three to five times the gasoline consumption of European cities, despite offering at least the same quality of life.<\/p>\n<p>A closer look at specific factors contributing to carbon efficiency reveals the dynamics of how a certain compact urban territory can outperform its hinterland or sprawling spatial configurations. Two decisive factors are reducing energy consumption associated with buildings and transport. The amount of energy per square metre needed for heating and cooling a building is highly dependent on the basic building configuration. For example, joint research by Urban Age and the European Institute for Energy Research has shown that detached houses with the same insulation standards and location in moderate climates require more than three times the energy per square metre compared to multi-storey city blocks.<\/p>\n<p>In the case of transport, the positive \u2018urban effect\u2019 is two-fold. Firstly, it means a closer proximity, and, secondly, it equates with a shift towards more environmentally friendly modes of transport. Compact city configurations generate high levels of accessibility while reducing travel intensity. Barcelona and Atlanta, for example, have similar populations but their built-up territory is vastly different at 162 and 4,280 km2 respectively; the longest travel distance between two points in the city is almost four times longer in Atlanta. Generally speaking, three key spatial factors \u2013 density, mixed-use and poly-centricity \u2013 influence the creation of proximity in cities. No single factor reigns supreme. Considered equally, they can also play an important role in increasing the use of sustainable transport modes such as walking, cycling and public transport.<\/p>\n<p>A city\u2019s ability to accommodate more environmentallyfriendly lifestyles is linked to a range of interrelated factors, from high rates of apartment living to low car dependency. But the primary appeal comes from the potential to link these two factors to social services, cultural amenities and economic opportunities unknown to territories that are characterised by the opposite.<\/p>\n<p>A city\u2019s ability to accommodate more environmentallyfriendly lifestyles is linked to a range of interrelated factors, from high rates of apartment living to low car dependency. But the primary appeal comes from the potential to link these two factors to social services, cultural amenities and economic opportunities unknown to territories that are characterised by the opposite.<\/p>\n<p>Such successful models of change can only be brought about with, and not against, citizens. Over centuries, cities have been progressive environments embracing individual changes in behaviour \u2013 a central prerequisite for the emergence of more sustainable lifestyles. As dynamic and reflexive organisms, cities can be quickly mobilised to implement and test new approaches while receiving immediate feedback from residents. The long list of recent transport innovations is a revealing one: strategies such as congestion charging (London, Stockholm, Milan), urban cycling (Copenhagen, Bogot\u00e1, Paris), bus rapid transit systems (Curitiba, Bogot\u00e1, Istanbul) and temporary street use (Rio de Janeiro, New York, Tokyo) are paving the way for world-wide application. And they have already reduced green house gas emissions: each year Calgary\u2019s new light rail saves about 590,000 tonnes, London\u2019s Congestion Charge 120,000 tonnes and Paris\u2019 Velib bike-sharing scheme 18,000 tonnes. These instructive examples illustrate the enormous potential for political convergence around a climate policy with socio-economic urban objectives. Low carbon cities will significantly improve the quality of life long before reductions in carbon emissions will limit the effects of global warming.<\/p>\n<p>To underline the urban potential of greening our societies, we must clearly differentiate between resourceintensive urban agglomerations and energy-efficient cities \u2013 not all settlements of a certain size or within a metropolitan region exhibit the core qualities of a city. But if a city can prioritise the sharing of resources, widespread use of public amenities and ultimately an energy-efficiency combined with social opportunity, city making will help provide solutions to the global environmental crisis.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":"http:\/\/v0.urban-age.net\/publications\/newspapers\/istanbul\/articles\/04_PhilippRode\/en_GB\/04_PhilippRode_en.pdf","article_publishing_date":"November 2009","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"22","name":"Philipp","created":"2011-10-04 13:03:47","modified":"2013-11-14 11:36:32","slug":"rode-philipp","family_name":"Rode","title":"","email_address":"p.rode@lse.ac.uk","photo_legacy":"\/0_images\/02-PRode.jpg","profile_text":"Philipp Rode is Executive Director of LSE Cities and Senior Research Fellow at the LSE.

Originally from S\u00e3o Paulo, Nelson described how he found the perfect backdrop to the narrative of the ambiguous relationships of proximity and distance between the bourgeoisie of the asphalt, and the majority black population and rogues living on the hillsides in the South Zone of Rio de Janeiro. Although spatially close, that did not mean that they were integrated. In S\u00e3o Paulo, the <em>favelas<\/em> were not as exposed as those of Rio, juxtaposed with middle-class apartment buildings of the characteristic hillsides, typical of Rio de Janeiro&#8217;s South Zone. With its depiction of Brazilian reality through one day in the life of five kids in a <em>favela<\/em> in the North Zone \u2013 Morro do Cabu\u00e7u \u2013 who sold peanuts in Copacabana, P\u00e3o de A\u00e7\u00facar hill, and at the Maracan\u00e3 stadium, some of the city&#8217;s main tourist attractions, the film inspired the Cinema Novo movement.<\/p>\n<p>Since then, socio-spatial relationships in the city of Rio de Janeiro have deepened, and cannot be viewed simplistically through dual oppositions, as is sometimes attempted. Between the hills and the asphalt, legality and illegality, or even in the idea of a divided city, there is a lot more. The classic definition of rich central areas and poor outskirts manifested itself alongside the existence of pockets of poverty within wealthy neighbourhoods. The relations of proximity and distance between social groups focused on their material expressions, juxtaposed throughout the city, and came to represent and structure the metropolis of Rio de Janeiro.<\/p>\n<p>The <em>favelas<\/em>, seen as a place of poverty, samba and trickery, and precarious areas ignored by public authorities, have gone through significant transformations since then. From the early 1970s onwards, the \u2018urbanisation\u2019, or upgrading, of the <em>favelas<\/em> has provided positive experiences in some communities that received infrastructure and pavements, the basic requirements of urbanisation. In Rio de Janeiro, for instance, this process was strengthened in 1993 and following years with the Favela-Bairro programme created by the Municipality.<\/p>\n<p>However, perhaps the most remarkable aspect of low-income settlements \u2013 including the <em>favelas<\/em>, but also the irregular land divisions and housing complexes \u2013 is the presence, from the 1990s onwards, of armed violence, which has settled into those areas in connection with drug trafficking. The existence of areas dominated by organisations, gangs or commandos came to define territories of exception, characterised by the \u2018absence\u2019 or \u2018scarcity\u2019 of the State, shaping a social reality in which there is no rule of law. It is only since 2008 that these areas have been tackled by public authorities, through the Pacifying Police Units, or UPPs. What we need is a better way to understand how these areas have come about and how they are ingrained in the political, social and economic fabric of the city.<\/p>\n<h1>The origins of armed violence<\/h1>\n<p>Initially, the city treated <em>favelas<\/em> as provisional settlements, with the expectation that development would soon arrive and replace them. This meant that these sites were ignored. This was followed by a period in which the Brazilian State banned them, at the same time as it discouraged the construction of rental housing and took up the task of producing subsidised homes \u2013 a task that was evidently not accomplished. The <em>favelas<\/em> could not be part of the city map.<sup>1<\/sup> And since they were not on the map, the problem was solved. This legal determination prevailed even into the 1990s.<\/p>\n<p>Irregular developments, in turn, appeared in the mid-twentieth century, at a time when accelerated population growth could not be accommodated in rental houses and when there was no funding for the construction of homes. The families that did not want to live in the <em>favelas<\/em> occupied new areas in the West, building their own houses.<\/p>\n<p>We could think that both the <em>favelas<\/em> and the clandestine development areas resulted from low-income families adopting the nuclear family model, which they achieved without support from collective savings. Thus, <em>favelas<\/em> and irregular settlements did not come about as a rejection to the city; they actually show the willingness of poor people to integrate in the city.<\/p>\n<p>Housing complexes are the result of government decisions. Throughout the middle decades of the last century, complexes were built as the main \u2013 and almost exclusive \u2013 housing policy action. Residential complexes were to a large extent aimed for the compulsory resettlement of families living in <em>favelas<\/em> that were demolished by public authorities.<\/p>\n<p>In Rio de Janeiro, recent data (2010) indicates the existence of about 425,000 households in 763 clusters called \u2018subnormal\u2019, including <em>favelas<\/em>, irregular development areas, and settlements without infrastructure or land ownership. These numbers suggest that about 1.5 million people live in informal areas, or about 25 per cent of the population of Rio. The first census of the <em>favelas<\/em>, carried out in 1948, revealed the existence of about 35,000 households, 138,000 inhabitants, or 7 per cent of the total population. This significant increase marks the tortuous trajectory of poor people in relation to the city\u2019s housing stock.<\/p>\n<p>Figure 1: Map of the city of Rio de Janeiro indicating the <em>favelas<\/em> and irregular settlements.<br \/>\nSource: Instituto Pereira Passos, 2000<\/p>\n<p><em>Favelas<\/em>, developments and housing complexes are the three main models of low-income urban settlements in Brazil. In Rio de Janeiro nearly half of its population lives in these conditions. This is clear when we look at the city map.<\/p>\n<h1>Common conditions<\/h1>\n<p>From the point of view of access to infrastructure and urban services, the degree of integration of these settlements varies. But there is a condition common to almost all of them: the absence of the State. Governments are not as present as they are in the ordinary city \u2013 on the asphalt. Even in the residential complexes of Cidade de Deus, Vila Kennedy and Vila do Jo\u00e3o\/Mar\u00e9, where regular settlements were created, governments usually do not provide good public services to the residents.<\/p>\n<p>Regularisation of property, for instance, does not exist, even though the earliest communities date back to the 1960s. \u2018Absence\u2019 or \u2018lack of State presence\u2019 is not a way of saying public services are bad, it is much more: a reality in which there are no effective laws governing society. In most of these low-income settlements, tenancy law does not apply. Relationships between landlords and tenants are mediated by forces that do not comply with the Brazilian Constitution. In case of tension, the parties will seek to resolve their conflicts with support from the powers that replace the absent State.<\/p>\n<p>The tax code and building laws have no power either. In those <em>favelas<\/em>, in case of land divisions and housing developments where the State is not present, there are no guarantees that the right to legal defence, the right of the adversary or the right to come and go \u2013 key pillars of the Brazilian Constitution \u2013 will be respected. So, what are the rules in force? How are they established? Who enforces them?<\/p>\n<h1>Structuring of territorial control<\/h1>\n<p>Without a rule of law, these settlements are at the mercy of organisations or gangs for which the areas have some value. In general, the value attributed is one linked to the drugs trade. Today this business is certainly a relevant aspect, but it is no longer the only one, and perhaps not even the most important.<\/p>\n<p>Illegal trade of public services, like transport, communications and electricity, are part of everyday life in these settlements, the control of which has acquired increasing value. Recently, with the advent of the <em>mil\u00edcias<\/em>, security services were also created. The construction of irregular housing is another very profitable business, with much better profits than the ones in the formal housing economy. And, as rent collection cannot be dissociated from the \u2018dissuasive argument\u2019 of the strongest, it reinforces the circle of illegality, secrecy, and of the better armed.<\/p>\n<p>In Rio de Janeiro, the way territorial control is structured is no longer based on drugs sales points, but on a network. By consolidating itself, this network of illegality forms \u2018islands\u2019 that are controlled by different laws. The absolutists at the top exceed the control of their territories and expand their tentacles beyond the archipelago. Thus, the network also unfolds over the legal urban fabric and reaches successive neighbourhoods and important regions of the city.<\/p>\n<p>Figure 2: Network taking over the territory.<\/p>\n<p>Thus, in these territories ignored by the State, an economic-political-social network has been established with negative impacts on the economy, politics, society, and urban life.<\/p>\n<h1>Causes and effects x recovery and permanence<\/h1>\n<p>Since urban violence has become part of everyday life, it was first understood to be part of the economic forces of modernity. Trapped between authoritarianism and social chaos, illegality was seen as part of a kind of political protest. Next, violence was treated in a context of symbiosis between marginality and the agents of the State, where corruption was the common element. To this we could add the absence of fully-shared moral boundaries, which attributes a certain incentive to illegality in the pursuit of social mobility. Permeating these stages, there were several ways to tackle violence based on the role of the repressive apparatus of the State, which assumed greater or lesser importance, without connections to the social, political or economic causes.<\/p>\n<p>It was only after the Brazilian State lost its legitimacy \u2013 and citizens their spirit \u2013 that the Pacifying Police Units, or UPPs, started to be deployed from 2008 onwards. Since then, there has been an arduous attempt to re-constitutionalise those territories. This does not mean the end of clandestine networks. On the contrary, the symbolic recovery that is the result of the presence of the State in these areas represents the beginning of a new process.<\/p>\n<p>Close, yet far from the rest of the legal city, those territories of exception are beginning to recover their citizenship. Permanent services, viewed as banal in great part of the city, such as regular refuse collection, home delivery of goods and mail, among others, in addition to the simple possibility for children to get to and from school in safety, have started to happen without the threatening control of drugs trafficking. With the now permanent presence of the State, it is a matter of time before services reach these areas. The ways vary, and new problems may arise. In the South Zone, boutique hotels have already arrived, and sightseeing tours take place in the pacified <em>favelas<\/em>, attracted by the proximity of the wealthy areas and the fine views over the city. However, many areas of the metropolis, especially the North Zone, from Bonsucesso to Iraj\u00e1, remain critical.<\/p>\n<p>Once the initial stages of recovery of these territories are overcome, one of the main challenges arising is the permanence of public services \u2013 which cannot be understood merely as the presence of police forces. Full consolidation of state control is essential. The recent mass protests have brought to the fore the issue of lack of consistent public urban development policies. Our cities still need a more cohesive agenda, with a much stronger commitment to urban development.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"<p><sup>1<\/sup>\u0002 According to Rio de Janeiro&#8217;s Municipal Legislation of 1937.<\/p>\n","pdf_uri":"","article_publishing_date":"October 2013","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"415","name":"Fabiana","created":"2013-10-17 09:41:16","modified":"2013-10-18 23:20:36","slug":"izaga-fabiana","family_name":"Izaga","title":"","email_address":"","photo_legacy":"","profile_text":"Fabiana Izaga is Vice-President for Institutional Relations of the Brazilian Institute of Architects - Rio de Janeiro.","organization":"","role":"","additional_affiliations":"","qualifications":"","staff_pages_blurb":"","office_location":"","display_after":"","display_until":"","extended_blurb":"","special_2012ec_blurb":"","special_2012ec_affiliation":"","special_2013rio_blurb":"Fabiana Izaga is an architect and professor at the Faculty of Architecture and Urbanism of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, and Vice President of the Institute of Architects of Brazil in Rio de Janeiro.

Within its North American context, New York\u2019s strong health performance may reflect significant investment and local autonomy in health care and its increasing targeting of health policies towards vulnerable neighbourhoods and at-risk groups, in an effort to reduce health inequalities and gaps in health care access.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<h3>London<\/h3>\n<div>\n<p><a href=\"\/files\/2011\/11\/CHW_R1_HDI_Case_Study_London_top_right-01.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-910\" title=\"CHW_R1_HDI_Case_Study_London_top_right-01\" src=\"\/files\/2011\/11\/CHW_R1_HDI_Case_Study_London_top_right-01.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1016\" height=\"1016\" \/><\/a>London\u2019s metropolitan region scores significantly better for health (0.79) and wealth (0.77) than it does for education (0.71). While London does better than all North American city regions in health, it scores lower than most other West European capitals in health and in education. In fact, the UK capital suffers from a significantly higher infant mortality rate than many other European capitals \u2013 with wide discrepancies between wealthier West London and the more deprived East London, which has for generations been home to immigrant communities. Within the UK, London performs strongly, particularly in relation to wealth, reflecting its role as an international financial centre and a key location for specialist service firms. This is translated at the European level by a high wealth score, with only Stockholm and Paris edging past it. By European standards, London is at the same time an attractive location for educated migrants and a site of low educational achievement with an unequal educational profile.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<h3>Istanbul<\/h3>\n<div>\n<p><a href=\"\/files\/2011\/11\/CHW_R1_HDI_Case_Study_Istanbul_bottom_left-01.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-911\" title=\"CHW_R1_HDI_Case_Study_Istanbul_bottom_left-01\" src=\"\/files\/2011\/11\/CHW_R1_HDI_Case_Study_Istanbul_bottom_left-01.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1016\" height=\"1016\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Istanbul\u2019s metropolitan region scores strongly in wealth (0.68) placing it among the top regions in emerging economies, but it achieves low scores in health (0.57) and education (0.52). Within Turkey, Istanbul also performs more strongly in wealth than in health or education, with literacy and infant mortality rates that mirror national averages. Ankara, the nation\u2019s capital, performs more strongly on education and health, with almost 9 per cent more of its population of more than six years of age having at least high school education. Its overall pattern is very similar to that observed for Brazilian regions, where improvements in wealth do not seem to have translated into better social conditions so far. Istanbul\u2019s low scores in health and education may be explained in part by national school attendance patterns (adults achieve only 6.5 years of schooling on average, for example) and the high levels of rural in-migration from areas that suffer from significant regional inequalities.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<h3>Mumbai<\/h3>\n<div>\n<p><a href=\"\/files\/2011\/11\/CHW_R1_HDI_Case_Study_Mumbai_bottom_middle-01.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-912\" title=\"CHW_R1_HDI_Case_Study_Mumbai_bottom_middle-01\" src=\"\/files\/2011\/11\/CHW_R1_HDI_Case_Study_Mumbai_bottom_middle-01.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1016\" height=\"1016\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Mumbai\u2019s extended urban region scores lower in education (0.44) than in health (0.54) or wealth (0.56), a pattern similar to the Chinese city regions. It is India\u2019s second-highest scoring city in education behind Kochi, and its third-highest scoring city in health, following closely behind Kochi and Chennai. With more than half its population living in slums, Mumbai\u2019s low international performance across all indicators reflects its lack of basic infrastructure, insufficient formal housing and lack of access to education, health and formal employment on international standards. Yet Mumbai significantly outperforms the national average across all measures. In relation to health, for example, 88.1 per cent of children are completely immunised, compared to 53.3 per cent nationally, and in terms of material welfare, 86.1 per cent of households have access to a toilet, compared to 49.3 per cent nationally.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<h3>Shanghai<\/h3>\n<div>\n<p><a href=\"\/files\/2011\/11\/CHW_R1_HDI_Case_Study_Shanghai_middle_right-01.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-913\" title=\"CHW_R1_HDI_Case_Study_Shanghai_middle_right-01\" src=\"\/files\/2011\/11\/CHW_R1_HDI_Case_Study_Shanghai_middle_right-01.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1016\" height=\"1016\" \/><\/a>Shanghai is weaker in education (0.53) than in either health (0.62) or wealth (0.67), a pattern that is common to most urban areas in the region.

Its strong economic performance at a global level \u2013 similar to Mexico City, S\u00e3o Paulo and St Petersburg \u2013 and within China reflects its role as the country\u2019s financial capital, with the relative autonomy to implement pro-growth policies. Its comparatively weak performance in relation to health and especially education may reflect Shanghai\u2019s rising inequalities (it has a Gini coefficient of 45), as well as the impact of China\u2019s hukou policy which, despite recent modifications, restricts access to basic services for rural-urban migrants.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<h3>Mexico City<\/h3>\n<div>\n<p><a href=\"\/files\/2011\/11\/CHW_R1_HDI_Case_Study_Mexico_middle_left-01.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-937\" title=\"CHW_R1_HDI_Case_Study_Mexico_middle_left-01\" src=\"https:\/\/v1.lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/11\/CHW_R1_HDI_Case_Study_Mexico_middle_left-01.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1016\" height=\"1016\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Mexico City\u2019s extended metropolitan region scores equally on all three dimensions, with 0.64 on both health and wealth and 0.62 in education. Internationally, it performs less well than North American cities on all dimensions, and is also surpassed by Buenos Aires and Monterrey in Latin America, but remains within the top tier of metropolitan regions for all three indicators reflecting a sustained effort to improve housing, education and health over recent years. The Distrito Federal, Mexcio City\u2019s central district with nine million residents, has put a strong focus on inclusiveness, especially of the elderly and informal workers; with important measures such as free access to medication for informal workers, large-scale health promotion campaigns and screening tests for non-transmitted diseases in the public space. However, the wider metropolitan area performs only marginally better than the national average across all measures used to calculate these indices. This unexpectedly low performance reflects the extremely extensive nature of its geographical boundary which embraces very diverse communities spread thinly across a wide area. In fact, within the vast urban conurbation of 35.4 million people, it is only the central Distrito Federal which has been able to concentrate health, education and economic resources effectively, while far less developed and low-performing surrounding regions may suffer from access to core services.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<h3>S\u00e3o Paulo<\/h3>\n<div>\n<p><a href=\"\/files\/2011\/11\/CHW_R1_HDI_Case_Study_SaoPaulo_middle_middle-01.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-914\" title=\"CHW_R1_HDI_Case_Study_SaoPaulo_middle_middle-01\" src=\"\/files\/2011\/11\/CHW_R1_HDI_Case_Study_SaoPaulo_middle_middle-01.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1016\" height=\"1016\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Reflecting its status as the economic powerhouse of the Brazilian economy, S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s wider metropolitan region scores well internationally on wealth (0.67), but underperforms on education and health (0.58), a pattern that is replicated at the national level. S\u00e3o Paulo outperforms Brazil significantly in economic terms but aligns itself to national averages in both health and education. This makes S\u00e3o Paulo one of the lowest scoring regions in South America on health, and places it in the same category as Turkish, Indonesian and Chinese urban regions. An explanation for this relatively low health score might be found in the fact that there is significantly more variation in health performance amongst the municipalities that make up the Brazilian city regions than there is in either education or wealth performance, suggesting that the high rates of income inequality in Brazilian cities (S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s Gini coefficient is 61) find their most extreme manifestation in health outcomes. Nonetheless, the city authorities have made a concerted effort to improve health conditions for its residents, and in 2000 integrated the national health insurance system, which guarantees free health assistance to all its citizens.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<h3>Johannesburg<\/h3>\n<div>\n<p><a href=\"\/files\/2011\/11\/CHW_R1_HDI_Case_Study_Johannesburg_bottom_right-01.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-915\" title=\"CHW_R1_HDI_Case_Study_Johannesburg_bottom_right-01\" src=\"\/files\/2011\/11\/CHW_R1_HDI_Case_Study_Johannesburg_bottom_right-01.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1016\" height=\"1016\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>With 0.62 in both education and wealth, Johannesburg is the highest-scoring metropolitan region in Africa, surpassing all Northern African cities and reaching levels similar to those observed in South America and China.

Despite Johannesburg\u2019s poor health performance internationally, it does better than the national average in this regard, while the picture is more mixed in education and wealth. Johannesburg\u2019s difficulties may stem from its high social and spatial inequalities (its Gini coefficient is 75, one of the highest in the world) and insufficient infrastructure, despite efforts towards universal education and health, housing and neighbourhood improvements.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":null,"article_publishing_date":"November 2011","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"67","name":"Antoine","created":"2011-10-28 10:01:40","modified":"2014-05-07 15:17:29","slug":"paccoud-antoine","family_name":"Paccoud","title":"","email_address":"a.m.paccoud@lse.ac.uk","photo_legacy":"","profile_text":"","organization":"Department of Geography and the Environment, London School of Economics and Political Science","role":"LSE Fellow in Human Geography","additional_affiliations":"","qualifications":"BA\nMSc\nPhD","staff_pages_blurb":"Antoine Paccoud\u2019s research is concerned with bringing human geography into conversation with the ideas of contemporary philosopher Alain Badiou, and in doing so, to show that this philosophy can be compatible with empirical social science.

It would not be an exaggeration to say that, if not for the harbour, there would be no Hong Kong as we know it today. The birth of Hong Kong as a city can be traced to the moment, in 1841, when Captain Elliot of the British East India Company raised the Union Jack with little fanfare on a little knoll on a small sub-tropical island off the southeastern coast of China, and declared its possession on behalf of His Majesty\u2019s Government. When the British Government learned of its latest possession, it was not impressed. The British Foreign Secretary, Lord Palmerston, went as far as describing Hong Kong contemptuously as \u2018a barren island, which will never be a mart of trade\u2019. But thrive Hong Kong did, in part thanks to its natural deep harbour, protected from the worst of the seasonal typhoons by the land masses of the island and Kowloon Peninsula. The harbour, named after one of Britain\u2019s most revered monarchs, has provided Hong Kong the essential means to be developed as a trading port and to flourish as a commercial city.<br \/> As Hong Kong grew and flourished as a British trading port city throughout the nineteenth century, it began to take shape as a city \u2013 the City of Victoria, as it was then known. It was a linear city that covered a thin belt of several kilometers along the northern coast of Hong Kong Island. As a trading port city, the habour was its lifeline, providing anchorage for merchant ships that brought goods in and out of the Chinese mainland. The city grew as the economy demanded, and towards the end of the nineteenth century it reached its limit, constrained by the very steep terrain inland. The option was obvious: create more land by filling in the coastal waters of the harbour. Thus, the northern coast of Hong Kong Island underwent a number of reclamations, so much so that almost no natural coastline remains today.<br \/> At the turn of the century, Hong Kong\u2019s territory became definitive, and it included Hong Kong Island (acquired after the First Opium War), Kowloon Peninsula (after the Second Opium War) and a large expanse of hinterland known as the New Territories, as well as a number of assorted outlying islands (leased from the Imperial Chinese Government at the end of the nineteenth century). By the mid-twentieth century, the urban areas of Hong Kong had expanded to cover most of the northern coast of Hong Kong Island and almost the entire Kowloon Peninsula. The heart of urban Hong Kong, home to all major government and financial institutions, was (and still is) Central district, commonly known as \u2018Central\u2019. By this time, Central had developed to become truly worthy of the city\u2019s namesake \u2013 it was a district filled with exemplary colonial architecture of the Victorian era, and enriched with those of the Edwardian and Art Deco period.<br \/> The first half of the twentieth century saw little noticeable change to the architectural character of Central. The pace of change quickened in the 1950s, when Hong Kong began industrialising and transformed itself from a trading port city into a regional manufacturing industrial hub. Modern mid-rise commercial buildings began to appear along the skyline. By the late 1970s, Hong Kong underwent another transformation, as the labour-intensive manufacturing industry started its exodus to the post-Mao open-door China to take advantage of the abundant cheap labour. The economy shifted to finance and service-based industries for international companies. The demand for higher-quality commercial and residential property enabled the government to adopt a high land price policy to generate revenue. Hong Kong\u2019s economy was set on the path of dependence on commercial and residential property development. This new economy drastically quickened the pace of change in Central as the familiar Victorian and Edwardian buildings of the pervious eras were rapidly pulled down to make way for high-rise commercial developments that could better exploit the land\u2019s increased plot ratio. Central would never be the same again.<\/p>\n<h3>Enter heritage conservation<\/h3>\n<p>It has been argued that if the Hong Kong Government had had better conservation foresight in the 1970s, Central could have become a historic centre with architectural showpieces of the Victorian, Edwardian and Art Deco traditions, raising the quality of life and well-being for all of Hong Kong\u2019s inhabitants. Unfortunately for Central, the government took on built-heritage conservation as part of its official portfolio (in 1976) at a time when Hong Kong was starting to shift to the land and property development-driven economy that continues to prevail today. In order not to impede mega-revenue generating development projects, conservation, particularly in urban areas, was given low priority. Conservation was relegated to part of the leisure and cultural services (in the same league as the role of public museums), overseen by an appointed advisory board, whose early membership consisted of a number of people directly or indirectly associated with the property development industry, and executed by an agency low in the governmental hierarchy. The telling sign of the lack of priority given to built-heritage conservation lies in the lack of an open, comprehensive policy (such a policy is still in the process of formulation at the time of writing). The conservation of buildings in the urban areas, where land and property prices are phenomenally high, was (and still is today) carried out in an ad-hoc manner, if it was carried out at all, and dealt with on a case-by-case basis.<br \/> Since the enactment of legislation for heritage conservation in the mid-1970s, statutory protection of heritage buildings has been officially, and artificially, limited to those built before World War II, which means that the vast majority of such buildings would now be found in Hong Kong\u2019s rural areas \u2013 the New Territories \u2013 and not on the much more expensive urban land. Further limitation comes in the means to statutorily protect a heritage building, which is to have the building in question be declared a \u2018monument\u2019. The problem is that such a restrictive declaration does not distinguish between a truly monumental building (major colonial government buildings, cathedrals, Chinese temple complexes, for example) and a humble shophouse. In the 20-year escalation of urban property prices (until the property bubble burst during the onset of the Asian financial crisis in 1997), many privately-owned older urban buildings were unceremoniously demolished since they were not deemed sufficiently significant to justify getting in the way of financially super-rewarding redevelopment plans. Only those buildings that stood on sites with specific land-use restrictions and therefore limited development potentials (for example, important public and religious buildings) were declared \u2018monuments\u2019. Adding to the conservation woes was the lack of public support for conservation. In the early 1980s, the British and the Chinese Governments signed the Joint Declaration that sealed the fate of Hong Kong, which would cease to be a British colony and become an autonomous Special Administrative Region of the People\u2019s Republic of China on 1 July 1997. During this transitional period of sociopolitical uncertainty and, incongruously at the same time, economic prosperity, who in their right mind would want to pay serious attention to heritage conservation? The general attitude of the educated and professionals at the time was to exploit the economic prosperity and plan for emigration.<\/p>\n<h3>People power and urban conservation<\/h3>\n<p>Since the return of Hong Kong\u2019s sovereignty from Great Britain to China in 1997 (in the British tradition of grand understatement, the event is known as the \u2018Handover\u2019), there has been a perceptible change in the mindset of the people of Hong Kong about heritage conservation. The return of a highly developed Hong Kong to the relatively less well-developed Chinese motherland has prompted a desire among Hongkongers to cultivate their own distinctive identity of being \u2018Hong Kong-Chinese\u2019. At the same time, the highly educated younger generations (thanks to vastly increased tertiary education opportunities in place since the late 1980s) no longer buy into the idea that the government\u2019s high-land-price policy and intense property development strategy are crucial for the economy. Unlike their predecessors, who were more singularly focused on archiving prosperity, the younger generations are more concerned with environmental issues, such as protecting the natural environment, reducing pollution and improving the quality of the living built-environment.<br \/> Since the Handover, raising public awareness in heritage conservation has enabled a number of privately owned heritage buildings to be rescued from demolition. Public support for conservation has been further enhanced by elected politicians (legislative and district councillors), who have discovered the potential for political gains by adopting heritage conservation as part of their political platform. Such unprecedented public support for conservation helped to justify the equally unprecedented use of public money to purchase \u2013 at a cost of more than US$6.4 million (HK$50 million) \u2013 a piece of urban heritage property for adaptive reuse as a public museum. Public outcry was also instrumental in stopping privately owned historical buildings from being torn down or sold for redevelopment. None of these conservation success stories is related to Central, since the district has been almost fully developed into a high-rise, high-density built-environment. Successive reclamations have also ensured that no pre-World War II building exists along the waterfront of Central facing the Victoria Harbour.<br \/> However, Victoria Harbour, which factors so significantly in Hong Kong\u2019s development, has become significant in the city\u2019s urban conservation. At the dawn of the twenty-first century, architecture along the Central harbour-front was represented by a cluster of buildings of the early Modernism tradition: the Star Ferry Pier and Clock Tower; Queen\u2019s Pier and the City Hall Complex. Popularly labelled the \u2018Bauhaus style\u2019 by the local media, these 1950s\u20131970s buildings are characterised by their austere functional appearance, which departs from the popular aesthetic notion of \u2018historic buildings\u2019 that are worthy of conservation. These relatively undervalued buildings had been slated for redevelopment under the original plan to reclaim the coastal waters of the Victoria Harbour in Central formulated in the 1990s. After the Handover, disagreement with the harbour reclamation plan became increasingly vocal, as NGOs and environmental groups began to point out the unsustainable nature of continuously filling in Hong Kong\u2019s precious Victoria Harbour for the sake of creating more land for property development.<br \/> The turning point in urban heritage conservation in Hong Kong came about when the 1950s Star Ferry Pier and Clock Tower, which had become iconic landmarks along the harbour-front in Central, were demolished amid public protest in early 2007. The ferocity of the public outcry took the government by surprise, and it happened at the most awkward time for Hong Kong\u2019s Chief Executive (essentially, the title for the post-colonial governor), who was at the eve of seeking re-election, and could not be seen as not having the mandate of the Hong Kong people for his appointment (a key reason for the early resignation of the previous Chief Executive).<br \/> To pacify the confrontation sentiment of the pro-conservation public, the government released a list of nearly 500 \u2018graded historical buildings\u2019 \u2013 buildings whose heritage values have been evaluated for possible statutory protection (the grading itself is not legally binding). Significantly, about half of the buildings in the list are privately owned and located in urban areas. While such a list was known to exist, it had been kept as a confidential document, partly in order not to affect private property development plans, and partly to protect the buildings from their owners, who might resort to demolishing their graded properties for fear of statutory protection limiting their potential development gain. The official release of this list had the effect of stopping redevelopment plans for the listed properties because developers are weary of the fierce public objection that might incur.<\/p>\n<h3>The future<\/h3>\n<p>The year 2007 will probably go down in history as the year when the people of Hong Kong collectively woke up to the call for protecting their built-heritage, particularly so in the urban context. Since the demolition of the Star Ferry Pier and Clock Tower, issues of urban conservation have been widely discussed and debated not only within academic and professional circles but also in the mass media. People are now more willing to give priority to conservation than redevelopment because of the increasing understanding that urban conservation is not a means to an end, but a component for sustainable development of a city. For Victoria Harbour, it would appear that the continuous reclamation of its waters has finally come to an end, as environmental and heritage conservationists have rendered such artificial land creation politically unfeasible. However, long-term protection of the harbour-front can only be possible when conservation becomes integrated with urban design and planning. Such integration has been missing in the urban development of Hong Kong. The recent successful re-election of the second Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region has brought hope. It has been announced that a new policy bureau will be set up, which combines the departments responsible for land-use, urban planning and conservation. This has long been advocated by local professionals and academics, but only realised with the changing sociopolitical reality in post-Handover Hong Kong.<br \/> For the authors, as faculty members of China\u2019s first and only master degree level academic programme in conservation \u2013 the Architectural Conservation Programme at the University of Hong Kong \u2013 we are pleased to see that built-heritage conservation is no longer considered an obscure branch of studies lumped together with museums and antiquities. What the programme has been advocating, that urban conservation should be an essential component of the sustainable development of Hong Kong as a city, has finally been given its due recognition. Many of the principles and ideas taught and advocated in the programme have become widely discussed not only in academic circles but also by the public through the mass media. When the programme was first established in 2000, the common reaction was, \u2018What\u2019s there to conserve in Hong Kong?\u2019. Now, the common response is, \u2018There is so much we need to conserve in Hong Kong, and we\u2019re not doing enough\u2019. For the loss of the Star Ferry Pier and Clock Tower, Hong Kong has gained one small step in the sustainable development of the city, and a significant step in the continual effort for better urban conservation and improved quality of life.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/11\/2011_chw_3020_Yin-DiStefano.pdf","article_publishing_date":"November 2011","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"106","name":"Lynne","created":"2011-11-04 10:00:38","modified":"2011-11-04 10:00:38","slug":null,"family_name":"DiStefano","title":null,"email_address":null,"photo_legacy":null,"profile_text":null,"organization":null,"role":null,"additional_affiliations":null,"qualifications":null,"staff_pages_blurb":null,"office_location":null,"display_after":null,"display_until":null,"extended_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb_lang2":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation_lang2":null,"phone_number":null},{"id":"105","name":"Ho Yin","created":"2011-11-04 10:00:15","modified":"2011-11-04 11:23:54","slug":null,"family_name":"Lee","title":null,"email_address":null,"photo_legacy":null,"profile_text":null,"organization":null,"role":null,"additional_affiliations":null,"qualifications":null,"staff_pages_blurb":null,"office_location":null,"display_after":null,"display_until":null,"extended_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb_lang2":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation_lang2":null,"phone_number":null}],"attachments":false,"gallery":{"slug":false,"extra_classes":"","slides":[]}},{"request_language":"","current_page_uri":"\/media\/search-dev.json","lang2_slug":false,"lang2_name":false,"parent_publication_id":11,"featured_image_uri":"","article_title":"Deciphering Istanbul","permalink":"deciphering-istanbul","article_subtitle":"","article_abstract":"<p>For \u00d6mer Kan\u0131pak, Istanbul is like a wrinkled cloth, a camouflage pattern of histories, with all routes leading to the Bosporus.<\/p>\n","article_summary":"","article_text":"<p><div id=\"attachment_736\" style=\"width: 767px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-736\" title=\"08_00\" src=\"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/11\/08_00.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"757\" height=\"475\" \/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Istanbul\u2019s unique topography allows for unexpected vistas of the Bosporus, Golden Horn or the Marmara Sea.<\/p><\/div>\n<p>It\u2019s hard to evaluate a city in which you have resided for years. You get too accustomed to every detail that makes it beautiful as well as evil. As a resident of this huge organic mechanism, you know which things don\u2019t work well but you are also aware that it has its own characteristic features that make it unique and interesting, almost personifying it.<\/p>\n<p>A member of the global megacities league, Istanbul is counted as one of the major business, transportation, cultural and tourist hubs in Europe as well as the Middle East. Like any megacity, its exact population cannot be determined; even the official number fluctuates between 12 and 14 million, a figure greater than the populations of 40 European countries. It is a metropolis so large that it extends more than 100 kilometres across and almost joins with Tekirda\u011f and Izmit, the cities of the two adjacent provinces, to form the Northern Marmara megalopolis. Since the rural exodus in the 1950s, Istanbul\u2019s rapid population growth has caused problems with illegal settlements (gecekondu) which in turn have triggered deforestation, and transport, health care and education challenges among other urban issues.<\/p>\n<p>Istanbul currently lacks a strategic masterplan to coordinate development between the elected 39 municipalities. Even so, foreign investors are continually looking to enter the city\u2019s thriving property development market. This is partly because Istanbul remains a magnet for new residents from within the country and from abroad, as well as for global companies opening their Eastern European and Middle Eastern headquarters. But Istanbul is not counted as one of the most liveable cities in the world. Quality of life in Istanbul falls well below that in Vancouver, Copenhagen or London. According to the 2008 Mastercard Worldwide Centres of Commerce report, Istanbul ranks 57th of 75 cities compared for liveability, despite having one of the lowest crime rates. And for over 50 years, Istanbul has not been able to prevent illegal settlements emerging on the outskirts of the city, although clean water, electricity and the sewage system reach almost the entire population, including these illegal settlements. So what is working in Istanbul has still not been answered convincingly.<\/p>\n<p>One of the most obvious of Istanbul\u2019s unique features is its geography. Topography is the strongest factor in Istanbul differentiating it from other global megacities. Steep hills, valleys, and the sinuous curves of the Bosporus dramatically shape the city\u2019s urban pattern: its settlements and transport and even the ecology of the city. In Istanbul, the terrain creates the notion of orientation, almost inscribing a mental map of the city in the minds of its residents. Living in Istanbul one is constantly aware of water, a presence always in close proximity or just within view. One knows that the slopes of the valleys lead to the Bosporus or the Golden Horn. It is this presence of water straits and the city\u2019s rising topography which make the scene an omnipresent feature in the everyday life of Istanbul\u2019s citizens, an urban feature accessible by the majority without any social or economic class differentiation. And it is not a single scene but a collection of scenes from numerous vistas thanks to the dynamic topography of the city.<\/p>\n<p>The ability to experience the city with the visual senses creates an awareness of the whole, as if the whole city were an enormous stage or collection of screens. This is possible without an Eiffel Tower, a London Eye or similar iconic structure. So we can easily assert that topography is the major factor which makes Istanbul unique, even though it creates many problems for mass transportation. However, this distinguishing feature is not quite appreciated by the municipalities when drawing up the regional masterplan or building codes; it\u2019s as if the city is as smooth as a blank piece of paper. Where building height restrictions are linked solely to the plot area, topographical differences are not taken into account or are seen as obstructions to be overcome or erased.<\/p>\n<p>Another unique aspect of Istanbul is less obvious and harder to explain. In order to analyse the city, I offer a metaphor which may at first seem awkward: Istanbul is a piece of wrinkled cloth pinched in the middle by a blue string. From a distance this cloth appears to have a homogeneous pattern and colour of its own. However, upon close examination one realises that it is not a simple sheet of cloth but an assemblage of many different textiles, each with slightly different colours, hues, textures and shapes. Yet, it is not a patchwork of similar orthogonal shapes, a metaphor frequently used to describe any metropolis where diversity is a defining feature. It is more like a cloth that has a camouflage pattern, where the shapes are amorphous. One of the layers of these amorphous shapes may correspond to the social strata of the city, while the other overlaps with topography, and yet another corresponds to the characteristics of its built environment. These layers and shapes do not have a specific rule. Against these expectations, Istanbul becomes a surprising and dynamic city.<\/p>\n<p>At the northern end of the Taksim-Harbiye axis, for instance, is one of the city\u2019s most exclusive areas. It borders the Ni\u015fanta\u015f\u0131 neighbourhood, a predominantly residential area featuring high-end shops for luxury foreign brands. Steps away in the adjacent Ferik\u00f6y-Pangalt\u0131 neighbourhood, located on the slopes of the Dolapdere valley, are rows of apartment buildings and a rectilinear street grid which differ greatly from the interwoven streets and built form found elsewhere in the city. The social pattern of this area is also marked by lower income groups and strong neighbourhood relationships. And yet, at the lower end of the Taksim-Harbiye axis sit the congress centre, five star hotels and cultural facilities \u2013 the \u2018jewels of the valley\u2019. The same kind of juxtaposition can be found in any part of the city; in the gentrified urban grain of Cihangir, located near the low-income residents of Tophane and its neighbouring coastal business district. It is the relatively short distances between these unique areas that make the city unpredictable in every sense. The changing architectural styles, street patterns, topographical features, neighbourhood sizes and densities do not adhere to a rule that can be aligned to the social and economic characteristics of the inhabitants of these regions. Perhaps that is why the city lacks a strategic masterplan: until recently, analysis of this camouflage pattern has never been considered by the municipalities.<\/p>\n<p>The widely accepted western urban terminology proliferating in academia is not sufficient to explain the Istanbul condition. For instance, it is commonly argued that unlike Italy, Istanbul lacks squares which can be efficiently used for public spaces. However, the notion of public space in Istanbul is different from what it is perceived to be in western terminology. In Istanbul, public space does not occupy a static public square; it is defined as the axes where people move through and intersect in the city. The orthogonal zoning principles or other modes of gentrification applied in western cities cannot successfully be applied to the urban fabric of Istanbul.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, Istanbul should develop an urban language of its own. And it should do so using its inherent features and codes \u2013 the elements which have not yet been comprehended or critically analysed. Deciphering the camouflage pattern is a crucial investigation, one which can only be accomplished through the coordinated efforts of many disciplines brought together. This research should not be left to urban planners or architects alone; the built environment is just a fraction of the whole of the experience of city making. Sociologists, economists, and even psychologists should work together to analyse how these seemingly incongruous neighbourhood patterns may live side by side: not only the tones or textures of different regions but the stitches that bind these areas together are important. The tension between the amorphous shapes and different shadings of the social, economic, architectural and topographical strata is the binding force of this camouflage-patterned textile called Istanbul.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":"http:\/\/v0.urban-age.net\/publications\/newspapers\/istanbul\/articles\/08_OmerKanipak\/en_GB\/08_OmerKanipak_en.pdf","article_publishing_date":"November 2009","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"26","name":"\u00d6mer","created":"2011-10-04 13:41:15","modified":"2011-10-04 14:41:15","slug":null,"family_name":"Kan\u0131pak","title":null,"email_address":null,"photo_legacy":null,"profile_text":"","organization":"","role":"","additional_affiliations":null,"qualifications":null,"staff_pages_blurb":null,"office_location":null,"display_after":null,"display_until":null,"extended_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb_lang2":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation_lang2":null,"phone_number":null}],"attachments":false,"gallery":{"slug":false,"extra_classes":"","slides":[]}},{"request_language":"","current_page_uri":"\/media\/search-dev.json","lang2_slug":false,"lang2_name":false,"parent_publication_id":10,"featured_image_uri":"","article_title":"Democracy in Urban India","permalink":"democracy-in-urban-india","article_subtitle":"","article_abstract":"<p>As India steps up its plans to restructure its highly centralised urban governance system, K.

Many countries aspire to the title of being a good democracy. A true test will have to bear out if democracy is alive and kicking, not just at the national or local level, but across the country. If this yardstick is applied, India has some distance to go. The much-touted 74th Constitutional Amendment and Democratic decentralisation have had an uneven course. The exercise to amend the Constitution to provide a constitutional status and mandate for local bodies was initiated by the late Prime Minister, Rajiv Gandhi, but the initial focus was on the Panchayats. Later, it was felt that the enlarged structure of representation should be provided for urban local bodies as well, but Rajiv Gandhi\u2019s amendment bills did not pass muster in Parliament. The succeeding government of V. P. Singh attempted a composite legislation for both rural and urban local bodies, but that government did not last long enough. Eventually it was left to the Narasimha Rao government and the two committees of the Parliament to rework the Amendments, which became law as the 73rd and the 74th Amendments in 1993.<\/p>\n<p>The salient features of the 74th Amendment are briefly summarised. Urban settlements are classified as Corporations, Municipalities or Nagar Panchayats (a hybrid designed for settlements in transition from rural to urban). All these three categories, broadly labelled as Nagarpalikas, are to be constituted with representatives elected from territorial constituencies called wards. One-third of the seats as well as the chairperson\u2019s positions are to be reserved for women.<\/p>\n<p>Elections are mandatory and are to be conducted by constitutionally created State Election Commissions. Each municipal ward or a group of them should also have ward committees. Additionally, District Planning Committees and Metropolitan Planning Committees are envisaged for dealing with issues common to municipalities and rural areas in a district as well as multiple municipal agglomerations.<\/p>\n<p>The structure envisaged by the 74th Amendment is elaborate. For a total of 101 City Corporations and 1,430 Municipalities and 2,091 Nagarpalikas in the country, elections have now been held two to three times across the country. The number of elected representatives for all the urban local bodies is about 70,000. Of the 3,640 chairpersons of these bodies at least one-third are women. The All India Council of Mayors is also presently headed by a woman. These are all visible signs of a significant arithmetical change in the representative structure of the Nagarpalikas. The question is whether they amount to a functioning or effective democracy. Available evidence indicates several deficits.<\/p>\n<p>The first may be described as the \u2018decentralisation deficit\u2019. In the Indian Constitution, the powers of the state are described in three lists: the Union List pertaining to the Government of India, the State List and the Concurrent list. Local government is an item falling within the State List. If the domain of a state government is regarded as complete in respect to the items in the State List, then the domain of the local bodies can only be subsidiary or delegated from the State List. Though the 74th Amendment identifies as many as 18 functions in the 12th Schedule of the Constitution as pertaining to Nagarpalikas, by and large the state governments regard that the assignments of these functions are not mandatory but discretionary. Debates about this view have taken place within as well as outside the courts. The factual position is that the functional domain of the Nagarpalikas is largely decided by state governments and therefore highly uneven across the country. Even a service like water supply, considered as a basic municipal function, is performed by state governments or parastatal agencies in several states such as Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Kerala.<\/p>\n<p>To cite another example, urban planning (including town planning) is mentioned as the very first item in the 12th Schedule to the Constitution. Yet this function is rarely performed by a city corporation or a municipality. Invariably, a development authority set up as parastatal body performs this function, and in recent years town planning has become a highly contentious matter occupying significant time of the High Courts and the Supreme Court.<\/p>\n<p>Even where some functions are devolved, government control is pervasive. The state government reserve\u2019s administrative deficit is a result of the financial deficit. The sum total of municipal revenues and expenditure are less than five per cent of the government\u2019s as a whole.<\/p>\n<p>The role of the municipal chairpersons or the mayor is also unclear. While the Municipal or City Council has a tenure of five years under the Constitution, the term of the mayor or the chairpersons varies from one state to another. In most of the states, the mayors and the chairpersons are elected by and from amongst the elected councillors. In Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh they are elected directly by voters, though this does not entitle them to any significant power. In fact, most municipal laws vest the executive powers in an appointed official.<\/p>\n<p>A major casualty of this situation is accountability. Although the structure envisaged by the 74th Amendment is elaborate, the provisions with regards to decentralisation within a city are vague. At the municipal ward level, the Constitution provides for a committee of one or more wards but the composition of such a committee is left to be decided by the state government except in Kerala, where members of a ward committee are elected by various groups. The allocation of responsibilities between the city and the ward levels are also not specified. Ward committees, where they exist, have not emerged as effective platforms for local participation. Similarly, in large cities the Constitution envisages an intermediate level for groups of wards. Here again, the arrangements are left to the state governments.<\/p>\n<p>In a few states such zonal formations or committees do exist but they are comprised almost exclusively of Municipal Councillors. Since the ward committees do not have adequate participation and the zonal committees virtually exclude representatives from the public, lack of proximity between the elected representatives and the people has become yet another deficit.<\/p>\n<p>In a globalised world where the limits of national sovereignty are strained daily, demands of local autonomy raise doubts and fears about state or national integrity. Yet it has long been understood that even the most powerful of the national or state governments is not powerful enough to deal with its cities. Similarly even the largest city, with all its resources, cannot superimpose itself as a substitute for the state. Power sharing between the centre and the state has been a difficult process in India. The 74th Amendment has introduced a new dimension of power sharing between the states and the local governments.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, one should also take note of the readiness of the people to participate in matters of city management or development. Many Indian cities are blessed with numerous community-level and non-government organisations, although there is a significant hiatus between them and the elected representatives. Structures can indeed facilitate or restrict participatory processes. And that is an issue crucial in addressing the deficits in a democracy.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_142\" style=\"width: 658px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-142\" src=\"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/10\/DPA-RVA-0459.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"648\" height=\"432\" \/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Images of religious symbols painted on the compound wall of a residential building in Mumbai helps ensure that the street it demarks remains litter-free.<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":null,"article_publishing_date":"November 2007","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"40","name":"K.C.","created":"2011-10-04 14:54:14","modified":"2011-10-04 15:54:14","slug":null,"family_name":"Sivaramakrishnan","title":null,"email_address":null,"photo_legacy":null,"profile_text":"","organization":"","role":"","additional_affiliations":null,"qualifications":null,"staff_pages_blurb":null,"office_location":null,"display_after":null,"display_until":null,"extended_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb_lang2":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation_lang2":null,"phone_number":null}],"attachments":false,"gallery":{"slug":false,"extra_classes":"","slides":[]}},{"request_language":"","current_page_uri":"\/media\/search-dev.json","lang2_slug":false,"lang2_name":false,"parent_publication_id":19,"featured_image_uri":"","article_title":"Designing Density in Karachi","permalink":"designing-density-in-karachi","article_subtitle":"Alternatives to Apartment Blocks","article_abstract":"","article_summary":"","article_text":"<p>Karachi contains 10 per cent of the total population of Pakistan and 25 per cent of its urban population, and yet it generates 15 per cent of national GDP and 62 per cent of income tax. In spite of being the major industrial city of Pakistan, in 1990 a total of 75 per cent of Karachi\u2019s working population worked in the informal sector, primarily in garment, leather, textile, carpet and light engineering sectors. These sectors, and therefore the majority of the working population, tend to be based in low-income settlements.<br \/> Land in Karachi is very unevenly distributed between the formal and informal sectors. A total of 62 per cent of Karachi\u2019s population lives on the 8.1 per cent of land that has been informally developed. And, while 80 per cent of Karachiites live in houses on plots of 120 square yards or less, plots of between 400 and 2,000 square yards occupy about 20 per cent of Karachi\u2019s residential area, despite accounting for only 2 per cent of the total housing stock.<br \/> The city government of Karachi has marked 72 per cent of informal settlements established before 1997 for regularisation, which involves the grant of a 99-year lease to residents and provision of physical and social infrastructure, while minimising the displacement caused. However, there is considerable pressure from a broad range of interest groups, including developers, bureaucrats, professional institutions and politicians, to initiate a process of replacing those settlements established before 1997 that are on prime land as well as all those established after 1997 with commercial developments, apartment blocks and shopping plazas. Added to this, there is considerable pressure from the same groups that new formal sector developments for low- and lower middle-income groups should follow the same principles.<br \/> Many of these new informal and formal low-income settlements are far away from employment zones, which makes it very difficult for residents, especially women, to work. Surveys show that people living in these settlements spend three to four hours per day travelling from home to work and back, at a cost of Rs 56 to 100 per day. In addition, social costs include a reduction in the time that workers, usually men, are able to give to their families, and increased tiredness and ill-health due to the time spent commuting in environmentally degraded and uncomfortable conditions.<br \/> Although land for housing is available in informal and semi-formal settlements, expanding families cannot access it easily as they did in previous decades, due to a massive increase in the cost of land. One square metre of land in a newly developed katchi abadi (neighbourhood) cost 1.7 times the average daily wage for an unskilled labourer in 1992, compared to 40 times today. As a result, the only affordable and secure option for an increasing number of families is to build upwards, densifying their settlements. Nawalane in Lyari, for example, had a density of 620 people per hectare in 1992, compared to over 3,250 people per hectare today. Similar conditions are emerging in most of the older informal settlements and in many formal settlements as well. Apartment complexes, which had an average of five or six people per apartment living in them a decade ago, now often have 12 to 15 people. Although high densities have numerous advantages for city and infrastructure planning, the abnormally high and unplanned densities emerging in the older settlements of Karachi are leading to significant social and physical problems. Overcrowded quarters can lead to family quarrels, tension among children and adolescents, promiscuity , inconvenience for married couples, breakdown of community cohesion, problems in use of toilets and kitchens, which increasingly have to be shared, and an increasing gap between water demand and supply.<br \/> Density is thus a critical issue in relation to sustainable urban planning, and so we conducted a series of four case studies in low- to lower middle-income housing sites in Karachi. The research, in collaboration with the Urban Research and Development Cell of the Department of Architecture and Planning at the NED University Karachi and supported by the International Institute for Environment and Development (UK) investigated three settlements of small plots and one apartment complex and included a hypothetical re-design exercise to explore how high density settlements could be constructed on these sites according to peoples\u2019 preferences, without compromising their living conditions.<br \/> The four case studies yielded a number of conclusions that could inform the planning of liveable high density housing in low- to lower middle-income areas. First of all, the vast majority of respondents and interviewees in the four settlements wanted to own a house and not an apartment. They pointed out that it was essential that they carry out some income generating activity in their homes, something that was not possible in an apartment complex, apart from activities such as giving tuition to school children. In addition, they preferred homes that could grow incrementally to house some of their married children, since finding separate accommodation was not an affordable option. Again, this was not felt to be possible in apartment buildings. There was a general consensus among those living in plot settlements that when they first built their homes, they did not consider the additions that they would make incrementally as their needs increased. As a result, their houses were badly planned and ventilated, and the settlements environmentally degraded. They agreed that if they had had access to design and technical advice when they first built their homes, they would not have suffered these problems to the same extent.<br \/> For the hypothetical re-modelling process we provided plots of 47 square metres. We were able to achieve much higher densities &#8211; up to 3,157 persons per hectare &#8211; than the Karachi Building Control Authority (KBCA) prescribed maximum of 1,275 persons per hectare for apartment blocks. This was true even in the case of the newly developed plot settlement: by remodelling it, we were able to increase the number of plots from 1,237 to 1,910. We made each plot narrower, reducing infrastructure costs and increasing density from 501 persons per hectare to 1,755 persons per hectare. In addition, the unit cost of a plot was reduced by 41 per cent.<br \/> There is, however, a limit to the density that can be reached without compromising on the quality of the physical and social environment. Houses higher than ground plus three floors on small lots are uncomfortable, and their living spaces on lower floors lack light and ventilation. Decreasing space for amenities and social facilities also adversely affects social and environmental conditions. In our re-planning exercise, we avoided increasing house heights above ground plus three floors or cutting back on amenities and social facilities. We also always kept a courtyard in the centre of each plot in order to provide light, air and an open family get together space Under these conditions, we found that it was not possible to achieve densities of more than 3,500 people per hectare..<br \/> Apartment complexes are more lucrative for developers than small-plot settlements because there is more housing for sale immediately after construction. Developers are therefore key agents in shaping the urban form of new and upgraded settlements. We therefore chose one case study that was the site of an existing apartment complex. Following discussions with developers, our re-design managed to achieve the same densities (around 2,800 people per hectare) as the existing apartment blocks, and the developers were satisfied with the profits that they could make under this proposal.<br \/> Our study has been widely circulated and discussed, and has also been used as teaching material at the Department of Architecture and Planning at the NED University in Karachi. Furthermore, a housing project in Lahore has asked us to design a settlement of eight hectares on the principles we have developed as a result of the study.<br \/> Plot settlements meet the requirements of low- and lower middle-income groups better than apartment blocks. They are physically and socially friendlier and are more affordable since they can grow incrementally as and when the need arises. Our study shows that they can achieve more than the densities prescribed by the Karachi authorities and can provide acceptable models for developers. People&#8217;s preferences in low- income settlements in other cities of Asia are not dissimilar to those we have documented in Karachi. It is necessary to develop appropriate bylaws and zoning regulations to promote high-density individually owned houses. The existence of an advisory cell or organisation that gives advice on incremental development would help such settlements to grow in a more organised manner.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/11\/2011_chw_5075_Hasan.pdf","article_publishing_date":"November 2011","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"134","name":"Arif","created":"2011-11-04 11:43:19","modified":"2011-11-04 11:43:20","slug":null,"family_name":"Hasan","title":null,"email_address":null,"photo_legacy":null,"profile_text":null,"organization":null,"role":null,"additional_affiliations":null,"qualifications":null,"staff_pages_blurb":null,"office_location":null,"display_after":null,"display_until":null,"extended_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb_lang2":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation_lang2":null,"phone_number":null}],"attachments":false,"gallery":{"slug":false,"extra_classes":"","slides":[]}},{"request_language":"","current_page_uri":"\/media\/search-dev.json","lang2_slug":false,"lang2_name":false,"parent_publication_id":35,"featured_image_uri":"","article_title":"Digital collaboration","permalink":"digital-collaboration","article_subtitle":"","article_abstract":"","article_summary":"","article_text":"<p>The promise of smart sustainable cities is predicated on the harmonious interplay of three forces: the dynamics of social media, allied to the analytics of Big Data, generated by a \u2018self-aware\u2019 urban infrastructure. Can these three forces be held in a productive tension? Can we harness emergent urbanism to the centralising tendencies of smart urban infrastructure? Are the biases inherent within social media consistent with the need for a broader civic empathy to address urban sustainability? Are we working with the primary drivers of urban life, or with the secondary drivers of infrastructural efficiency? As Cedric Price said in the mid-1960s: \u2018Technology is the answer. But what is the question?\u2019 This essay focuses on the issue that in smart cities, as much as with any other technology-led visions, we spend too little time thinking about questions.<\/p>\n<p>The vision of the smart city tends to focus on feedback loops generated by infrastructure, buildings, and vehicles, often by people looking for clients among national and municipal governments. But the city is something else: it consists of its people. We do not make cities to make buildings and infrastructure, we make cities in order to come together, to create wealth and culture. As social animals, we chose the city so that we could be with other people. Buildings, vehicles and infrastructure are mere enablers, not drivers. <\/p>\n<p>To see the city as a complex system to be optimised, made efficient, made smart, is to read the city along only one axis. But luckily, we are seeing more \u2018smart citizens\u2019 than \u2018smart cities\u2019; citizens use social media and related technologies to organise and act, through a flurry of crowd-sourced, crowd-funding platforms and collaborative city making. This crowd-led smart city needs no marketing and little urban infrastructure. It relies on loosely joined up open networks overlaid onto the city. Active citizens are knitting together their own smart city, albeit not the one envisaged by the systems\u2019 integrators and technology corporations. Might this process alone deliver resilient urban environments?<\/p>\n<p>The answer may be in the weak signals that indicate citizens are increasingly engaged in making decisions about their cities. Again, at its most viscerally obvious, we can see this in Tahrir Square, Zuccotti Park, Athens, Madrid, or recent underreported protests in urban China. Yet for all their impact, Occupy, the Arab Spring and last year\u2019s UK riots have not projected any kind of alternative structure for a new, resilient decision-making culture. Their effects tend to be unpredictable and uneven. <\/p>\n<p>Beyond these flashpoints, however, we can see numerous examples of a more systemic change: urban activism becoming urban activity. They enable the exploits of urban activists \u2013 today\u2019s equivalents of the heroics that produced New York\u2019s High Line, London\u2019s Coin Street, or Renew Newcastle in Australia, for instance \u2013 to be shared, copied, translated and scaled. What these emerging tools deliver is a blueprint for more rapid, even, and sustained change. Due to the inherent dynamics and platform characteristics of social media, such tools suggest a new interface with the city that could, potentially, alter the way in which most citizens interact with it.<\/p>\n<p>Over the last year many cities have witnessed an explosion in crowd-sourcing and crowd-funding platforms. In the wake of the increasingly high-profile crowd-funding platform Kickstarter, and popping up at the rate of one every couple of weeks, new platforms include Neighborland, In Our Backyard, SpaceHive, Brickstarter, Neighbor.ly, Change By Us, Give A Minute, Smallknot, Joukkoenkeli, Lucky Ant, I Make Rotterdam, as well as several more general crowd-funding services, occasionally bent into shape to serve as urban incubators \u2013 such as Indiegogo, PeopleFundIt, PleaseFundUs, Crowdfunder, and Kickstarter itself.<\/p>\n<p>Behind all these initiatives sits the basic notion that someone thinks of and pitches a local project, and people in the community \u2018back\u2019 that idea, typically donating small amounts of funding. The network effects of social media and the architecture of contemporary websites enable the projects to be tracked, discussed, updated, voted upon and funded. Several crowd-funding projects indicate that they might be able to generate significant resources, certainly enough to build catalytic funding at the start of projects, alongside mechanisms for otherwise backing, discussing or sharing best practice or tacit knowledge about how to get things done.<\/p>\n<p>This last aspect may be key. Traditionally, \u2018bottom-up\u2019 urban activism is the province of an individual who wants to give up every weekend for years, battling bureaucracy and inertia. They have to learn from scratch in each instance, as there are no breadcrumb trails to follow. With new platforms deployed, activism might become something akin to plain old <em>activity<\/em>, in which citizens are more deeply woven into the fabric of their city\u2019s decision making, by leaving traces for others to follow. This is the kind of thing the Web has done since day one. <\/p>\n<p>Entirely new governance models are implied as a result, with far more frequent, open and active engagement than a vote in the municipal elections every four years. City halls rarely have a meaningful \u2018suggestions box\u2019 on the front door, and these new platforms could be just that. By shifting where and how ideas come from, they might reverse a NIMBY (Not In My Backyard) tendency such that it becomes YIMBY (Yes In My Backyard!) through genuine collaboration and participation in city making, in stark contrast to the dreaded \u2018consultation\u2019.<\/p>\n<p>Equally, such systems might be read as \u2018desire paths\u2019 for a more ongoing, everyday form of deliberative democracy in urban governance. The promise is that, through the familiar transformative effects of \u2018The Network\u2019, the practice of urban development itself might change radically. This is in direct contrast to the public perception of the current system, where lumbering and opaque urban planning functions as a countervailing force against developers and politicians who are inevitably \u2018on the make\u2019. <\/p>\n<p>The premise behind this argument is that citizens want to engage in their city; that it is citizens, not planning departments or property developers, who are best placed to notice, suggest, aggregate and drive a certain kind of urban intervention. This \u2018Kickstarter urbanism\u2019 is typically oriented towards the small things in cities \u2013 let\u2019s turn this parking lot into a community garden, let\u2019s renovate a co-working space, let\u2019s start a bike-sharing scheme \u2013 rather than taking on urban governance models, or attempting to fund large-scale infrastructure.<\/p>\n<p>This in itself is not a criticism: what city would not benefit from people caring about the small things? But is there maybe the lingering sense that this might be a little \u2018bread and circuses\u2019? A stream of micro-distractions to occupy the community, focusing citizens on trying to crowd-fund a park bench while the big boys in government get on with the big stuff \u2013 education, transport systems, energy policy, grand civic buildings, housing, and so on?<\/p>\n<p>Social media can help catalyse an Arab Spring, but when used for a more local issue elsewhere \u2013 like Neighborland,enabling a proposal to extend commuter rail in Denver \u2013 it only attracts 50 \u2018neighbours\u2019 who agreed with the proposal. Their well-meaning comments are unlikely to change the situation much \u2013 that billions of dollars would need to be found, somehow, from within a culture not particularly predisposed to funding sustainable public transit. Neighborland is a wonderful example of a new platform, but it is, in itself, not enough to create a new decision-making culture for making more sustainable decisions. <\/p>\n<p>Although omnipresent, social media still betray the cultural conditions they were created in. NYU\/Harvard Law School researcher Alice Marwick&#8217;s analysis of social media centres on the assertion that they breed what she calls \u2018status seeking behaviour\u2019 (\u2018self-branding\u2019) within a \u2018competitive attention economy\u2019, transposing a Silicon Valley-derived model of neo-liberal principles onto social organisation. Douglas Rushkoff described a related set of biases in his book, <em>Program or Be Programmed<\/em>, in which he identifies decentralising or individualising tendencies. For Malcolm Gladwell, the critique rests on a variant of \u2018bread and circuses\u2019, that social media do not generate ties strong enough to engender the genuine action required to change a regime \u2013 or perhaps a city. Either way, side-stepping the question of ideology, if we accept that sustainability ultimately requires an intrinsic selflessness \u2013 right now, it is about subsequent generations, distant lands, global conditions, and often it is <em>not<\/em> in my backyard \u2013 then this should be, at the very least, a red warning light on the dashboard. <\/p>\n<p>All of this can be contested, of course. Clay Shirky\u2019s response to the Gladwell\u2019s critique, for instance, must be taken on board. He says that while digital networks \u2018do not (necessarily) allow otherwise uncommitted groups to take effective political action\u2026 they do, however, allow committed groups to play by new rules.\u2019 <\/p>\n<p>The Network\u2019s ability to connect can, of course, enable civic empathy as much as it destroys it \u2013 depending on how we work with its tools and materials. There is genuine potential in the new tools, if we see them as sketches and not as solutions. One might take these settling design patterns and scale them up to a new form of urban governance, based on more frequent, more engaged, shared decision making, and not simply in bread and circuses mode. And one could shape those governance cultures in such a way that they counterbalance the potentially destructive individualistic biases within social media, enabling citizens to act with meaningful responsibility for their city. Government is there to take disruptive innovations and productively absorb them into a resilient system, such that it smothers social inequalities and generates broader access. That goal need not be solely achieved through our current systems of increasingly disengaged citizenship. <\/p>\n<p>There is only one way to find out what balancing act might thrive under these new conditions, and that is to try it. \u2018Trying it\u2019 means considered, iterative prototyping of user-centred platforms; local experiments that can nonetheless scale up, and that are produced by designers, coders and city managers who understand both the Web and the city. There is no fundamental reason why municipalities could not work in this way, in terms of their strategic positioning, function and history. What if government was directly and boldly prototyping new versions of itself, using these new technologies: starting small, pivoting and scaling up, as all robust, resilient and popular contemporary systems do? It might be that a sense of public good, of civic responsibility, could be found within such a re-calibrated approach to municipal government. <\/p>\n<p>We are in a radically different urban condition than the post-Enlightenment era in which we invented the modern municipality. Not just in terms of built fabric, whose significance is overplayed due to its sheer obviousness, but in terms of our highly interconnected patterns of living. The nature of our challenges are entirely different, with climate change the clearest example. The very idea of the city as a public good fundamentally rests on our ability to transform our municipalities for the twenty-first century. And the very idea of the sustainable city relies on understanding that the city is a public good.<\/p>\n<p>For if sustainability requires us to think long term, we must surely create decision-making cultures that not only take the tendencies of these swirling vortices of individualism and short-termism into account, but actively counter them. Like judo, we might need to use the powerful dynamics of social media against themselves. Otherwise these opposing forces may cause shared cultures to tear themselves apart. <\/p>\n<p>What possible models for cooperative urban governance might emerge? Do we need a city in which citizens understand that they are part of a wider, more holistic system, and act accordingly? To be actively engaged with, as opposed to being passively observed and \u2018fed back to\u2019, as is the case with most myopic smart city visions? How might we enable patterns of sustainable living that nonetheless recognise that cities thrive on the very unpredictability and inefficiency of citizens; that the city\u2019s ecosystems will refuse to settle in \u2018natural equilibrium\u2019? How might we guide and shape a resilient city through shared governance cultures based on its incompleteness, openness and a sense of possibility, recognising that the city is a process, not a mere accretion of infrastructure?<\/p>\n<p>Are we sure that these ideas \u2013 drivers and enablers, unpredictability and inefficiency, prototyping and pivoting, personal and civic responsibility, active citizens and active municipalities, the city as public good, recalibrated governance \u2013 are part of the emerging smart city vision? For these are all part of what makes a city work, what makes a resilient city and what makes a good city rather than just a smart city.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":"","article_publishing_date":"December 2012","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"305","name":"Dan","created":"2012-11-28 16:36:20","modified":"2012-11-28 16:36:20","slug":"hill-dan","family_name":"Hill","title":"","email_address":"","photo_legacy":"","profile_text":"","organization":"","role":"","additional_affiliations":"","qualifications":"","staff_pages_blurb":"","office_location":"","display_after":"","display_until":"","extended_blurb":"","special_2012ec_blurb":"<p>Dan Hill is CEO of Fabrica, a communications research centre and transdisciplinary studio based in Treviso, Italy, and part of the Benetton Group.

Of course, nothing less should be expected from an airport that has been recognised as the \u2018World\u2019s Best Airport\u2019 eight times since 2000. Arrivals are welcomed with a myriad of transportation options and a subway system that will take you to the heart of the city in just 20 minutes.<\/p>\n<p>Hong Kong\u2019s world-class transportation system is no doubt one of the best there is. The city\u2019s Mass Transit Railway (MTR) carries an average of four million passengers every working day and is the primary mode of transportation for many of the city\u2019s inhabitants. Despite being one of one of the world\u2019s most densely populated cities, Hong Kong\u2019s sophisticated transportation grid makes it extremely well-connected.<\/p>\n<p>Only half an hour\u2019s drive from the airport is a shopping paradise in Tsim Sha Tsui, where the only thing longer than the endless list of shopping choices is the line of tourists waiting to enter each store. Just across the harbour is Central, where money is made as quickly as it is spent. Due to a highly efficient transportation network, most places in Hong Kong are readily accessible within an hour. This high connectivity, paired with incredible displays of wealth, is a stark contrast, however, to the districts that stand between tourists and their top shopping destinations.<\/p>\n<p>In the shadow of this wealth is another side to Hong Kong. Despite the 40 per cent GDP per capita growth over the last decade, which now stands at approximately US$32,000 (HK$249,000) per year, about 30 per cent of those on the lowest incomes actually make less money than they did a decade ago, while 10 per cent of the working population still earn less than US$10,000 (HK$78,000) per year. In the north and northwestern districts of Hong Kong, a short distance from the airport and the Chinese-Hong Kong border respectively, one will find communities that are isolated, vulnerable and characterised by poor financial conditions. They are often made up by \u2018broken\u2019 families and will experience higher suicide rates than communities in other districts within the city.<\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, some 150 migrants a day enter Hong Kong from the mainland, resulting in an increase in population of 54,000 each year. Many are the spouses and\/or children of the city\u2019s male migrants. Unlike their visiting counterparts (tourists from the mainland) these individuals are not that well off. They face challenges and difficulties in integrating into the local community and in finding work, a result of differences in language and of having qualifications that are not recognised within Hong Kong. Since newcomers face restrictions in receiving welfare, they have to work to meet their needs, usually taking on low-paid work and often finding themselves stuck at home during bouts of unemployment. Before the implementation of the minimum wage policy, some were being paid as little as US$500 (HK$3,400) a month.<\/p>\n<p>This year, however, sees a law being passed that will now protect these low-income groups from being further exploited. The minimum hourly wage has been set at the level of US$3.60 (HK$28), which is still very low in view of the rising inflation rate (now standing at 7 per cent) and the high living costs in Hong Kong. Many businesses, however, have objected to the law, claiming that it will lead to potential closure. However, since the law was introduced (in August 2011) the city\u2019s unemployment rate has reached an all-time low, at just 3.2 per cent. The fear that the older working population might lose their jobs has not been come to fruition. Indeed the most substantial expense for a business in Hong Kong is not its employees\u2019 wages but, in fact, ground rent, which can comprise up to 50 per cent of the total operating cost.<\/p>\n<p>The city enjoys a spectacularly high GDP growth of about 4\u20135 per cent each year. It not only has the most expensive housing in the region but also a very high income disparity. Hong Kong\u2019s Gini coefficient (a statistical measure of income disparity) is ranked as one of the highest in world \u2013 at 0.535 in 2010 \u2013 while social mobility, especially among the younger generation, is reaching stagnation. Those between the ages of 15\u201319 and 20\u201329 are more likely to face unemployment than any other group, with those in the 20\u201329 range experiencing rising unemployment (since 1991), irrespective of educational background. With no space, such expensive housing, less promising job prospects and the population squeeze, young people feel trapped and the opportunities are not as plentiful as before.<\/p>\n<p>Hong Kong is notorious for its small living spaces, an infamous example being the Kowloon Walled City, a densely populated settlement that was demolished in 1994. People still live in \u2018cage homes\u2019 or cubicle flats in such areas as Sham Shui Po, Mongkok and Kwun Tong, where temperatures within these habitats can reach upwards of 35\u00b0C (95\u00b0F) in the summer. To accommodate the rising population, satellite towns were developed in the 1970s, many of which were separated from the city centre by the mountains. Despite the high connectivity of Hong Kong\u2019s transportation system the distance of these new towns from the city centre, and consequently the greater travel costs of travelling between them, means that low-income groups living in these areas (such as Tung Chung and Tuen Mun, for example) are more isolated. Furthermore, these communities have been plagued with problems of inadequate job opportunities and public facilities, resulting in \u2018bedroom\u2019 communities within a high density of public housing estates. The relatively younger residents in these areas are generally less well educated and come from lower socioeconomical backgrounds than the general population of Hong Kong. These vulnerable groups face a host of problems, such as low wages, insecure or unstable jobs, domestic violence and suicide (the rates of which are 16\u201325 per cent higher than the population average). Even access to services provided by NGOs and other such organisations is characterised by a certain disconnection, possibly due to the distant branch\u2019s lack of communication with its headquarters.<\/p>\n<p>Especially at risk seem to be teenagers, many of whom have low self-esteem, lack problem-solving skills and consequently have poor mental health. They are also less likely to seek the help or support they need in order to address these problems.<\/p>\n<p>The well-being of older people living in these areas is also greatly affected. Due to their lack of mobility, a factor that relates more to the high cost of public transport than to how far they have to travel, they lack a firm social and family support network. As a result they become isolated and cut off from the community. Some were relocated from the older districts in Kowloon and Central to the newly developed districts in the north and western parts of Hong Kong. With property prices being sky-high and continuing to soar, relocating is not an option and so these populations are not only isolated but also trapped in these areas. Social networks have broken down due to such relocations and a new system has yet to be established. These older people feel disconnected. With Hong Kong\u2019s increasingly greying population and a dependency ratio standing at 334, and expected to increase rapidly in the next decade, the suicide risk for the elderly is a growing problem.<\/p>\n<p>Social deprivation and fragmentation unquestionably plays a role in the general mental health of the inhabitants of any given area. Steps need to be taken to ensure that these isolated and vulnerable districts are integrated into the rest of Hong Kong and that they receive the resources and attention they need in order to truly become a community. The success of a city cannot be measured only by its financial prowess; the mental health and the well-being of its residents must also be considered. What good will it do if property prices are skyrocketing on Hong Kong Island, at an average cost of more than US$21,500 per square metre, when half of all households have a living space of less than 46 square metres (500 square feet)? What good will it do to the local population if they cannot share the benefits of economic development? What sort of quality of life will Hong Kong\u2019s inhabitants have if they can\u2019t possess their own living space? We need to ask ourselves some very deep and hard questions. If this imbalance continues to grow and the income gap continues to widen as expected, is the whole development sustainable? Will it not cause social disharmony and unrest? Hong Kong will soon be connected to the mainland by a very fast train, with a speed of 300 kilometres per hour. However, there is still a substantial proportion of our community being left behind that have not been able to connect even to their own rapidly changing city. Once again, does Hong Kong move in a direction where the overall well-being of the city\u2019s inhabitants is at stake?<\/p>\n<p>Even with outstanding economic achievements and world-class infrastructure, a city is only as strong as its weakest link.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/11\/2011_chw_3010_Yip.pdf","article_publishing_date":"November 2011","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"104","name":"Paul S.

Some of the cities predicted to be among the largest in the world in 2025 were no more than villages and small towns in 1950. Then, Shenzhen had 3,148 inhabitants, Kinshasa 0.2 million, Jakarta 1.4 million, Chicago five million and London 8.4 million. In 2010, these five metropolitan areas all have roughly nine million inhabitants. By 2025, it is predicted that Chicago will reach ten, Jakarta and Shenzhen 11, and Kinshasa 15 million. London\u2019s population, on the other hand, is predicted to be no larger than it was 75 years before. The map above charts the size and growth of a selection of world cities with more than a million people from 1950 (white circle) to 1990 (light green circle) and indicates the projected growth to 2025 (dark green circle) based on UN predictions.<\/p>\n<p>While growth in many European and North American cities reached its peak by 1950, the rest of the world saw its cities grow most significantly in the next four decades. Tokyo grew by more than half a million inhabitants each year between 1950 and 1990, Mexico City and S\u00e3o Paulo by more than 300,000 each per year, Mumbai by around 240,000 per year and Manila and Cairo by approximately 160,000 per year. The only exceptions in this period were cities in China and Sub-Saharan Africa, which experienced only modest growth. But from the 1990s onwards, while cities continued to grow rapidly in South and South-east Asia (622,000 new inhabitants per year in Delhi between 1990 and 2010), cities in China started their growth spurt. The South Guangdong metropolitan area (which includes Shenzhen, Guangzhou and Dongguan) saw its 5.5 million inhabitants in 1990 increase six-fold to reach almost 32 million in just 20 years. In the next 15 years, it is predicted that the most rapid urban growth will take place in Sub-Saharan Africa where cities like Ouagadougou, Dar es Salaam and Kampala will double their population, and Lagos and Kinshasa will have to accommodate more than five and six million new inhabitants respectively. These predicted trends can be seen in the annual population growth rates for the 2010 to 2025 period highlighted for a selection of cities on the map.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_893\" style=\"width: 1498px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"\/files\/2011\/11\/Urbanisation-by-world-region1.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-893\" title=\"Urbanisation by world region\" src=\"\/files\/2011\/11\/Urbanisation-by-world-region1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1488\" height=\"711\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source: UN Population Division (2011).

The first displays the evolution of urbanisation levels for world regions, highlighting that the world\u2019s population is still divided; with one half living in highly urbanised nations and the other in nations in which most live in rural areas. The second chart shows the speed with which emerging economies in Latin American and Eastern Asia have caught up with North America and Europe in terms of life expectancy: Eastern Asia has gained close to 25 years of life in the space of 50 years. It also reveals how hard life expectancy in Africa has been hit by the HIV\/AIDS epidemic, which derailed it from its growth path in the 1990s, causing it to trail close to ten years behind South Central and West Asian countries.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":null,"article_publishing_date":"November 2011","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"67","name":"Antoine","created":"2011-10-28 10:01:40","modified":"2014-05-07 15:17:29","slug":"paccoud-antoine","family_name":"Paccoud","title":"","email_address":"a.m.paccoud@lse.ac.uk","photo_legacy":"","profile_text":"","organization":"Department of Geography and the Environment, London School of Economics and Political Science","role":"LSE Fellow in Human Geography","additional_affiliations":"","qualifications":"BA\nMSc\nPhD","staff_pages_blurb":"Antoine Paccoud\u2019s research is concerned with bringing human geography into conversation with the ideas of contemporary philosopher Alain Badiou, and in doing so, to show that this philosophy can be compatible with empirical social science.

Worth had written a trilogy about her life and work there as a young midwife and staff nurse at the London Hospital. Her best known title is \u2018Call the Midwife\u2019. It is a vivid account of life, birth and death in the tenement buildings of Tower Hamlets and a reminder of the impenetrable depth of poverty in the hinterland to London\u2019s docks. Much has changed for the better since then. The tenements have been replaced by vast estates of local authority housing, the contraceptive pill has played a key role in changing lives of the women there and Canary Warf, the new Royal London Hospital and the Olympic site dominate the skyline.<\/p>\n<p>But much has remained the same \u2013 at least relatively. A King&#8217;s Fund report recently noted that \u2018In London the life expectancy of the local population falls by one year with each station along the Jubilee Line between Westminster and Canning Town.\u2019 The Health and Wellbeing Strategy of Tower Hamlets noted in 2009 that \u2018Life expectancy is highest in Millwall ward in both males and females (80.2 years and 84.6 years respectively) and lowest for both in St Dunstan\u2019s and Stepney Green (71.9 and 78.2).\u2019 These wards are a short walk from each other. Tower Hamlets has the worst child poverty in the UK. The leader of a youth club within 182 metres (600 feet) of the heart of the City, with its bonus culture, explained in a matter-of-fact tone of voice that \u2018if you are not doing well in school you go into drugs and prostitution\u2019.<\/p>\n<p>This continuing social poverty breeds a lack of aspiration and hopelessness, which in turn has a deep impact on health. Across the whole of northeast London there is a large and growing number of people who are seriously overweight and take no exercise in spite of the excitement about the 2012 Games in their midst. The population eats too much of the wrong foods, smokes and drinks too much, and diabetes is growing alarmingly. The incidence of TB, once thought to have been eliminated in the UK, is growing fast and teenage pregnancy remains a huge issue. London has the highest rate of under-18 abortions and one of the highest rates of teenage conceptions in England.<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, east London remains an extraordinarily vibrant community. It is still the main \u2018arrival\u2019 point for migrants who, together, have built London into the world\u2019s most multicultural and diffuse city. This is now seen as a huge asset in terms of international competitiveness.<br \/> Improvement in school performance has been very marked in Tower Hamlets and Hackney recently and there is no doubt that this is beginning to lift the sights of a new younger generation, much of it in the Bengali and African Caribbean communities. However, there remain prior generations of school children untouched by this and therefore unemployed and without skills. Some 18 months ago The Equality and Human Rights Commission began to look at the NHS performance on \u2018equality duties\u2019. Their findings are deeply depressing. They say in bland language that &#8216;Much greater attention needs to be paid to leadership, commissioning and employment than \u2026 has been the case up to this point.&#8217; Put more bluntly, there needs to be a revolutionary attack on health inequalities in east London and it needs to begin now and involve and include all the public sector agencies and the private and third sectors working together to a precise timetable. The Olympic Games is the catalyst.<\/p>\n<p>Can this be done? The answer has to be \u2018yes\u2019 and here is how.<\/p>\n<p>Firstly, the huge investment around 2012 has to be the starting gun for transformation and there are at last real signs that the public sector is beginning to understand that they have it in their hands to build east London out of 150 years of poverty. Starting with health, Sir Mark Walport, Director of the Wellcome Trust, writing recently from a patient perspective in The Times, declared that \u2018All strands of health care, including primary, secondary and mental health must be integrated.\u2019 This is a very long way from the present position. Some of the Coalition Government\u2019s planned reforms may eventually help: there is a strong drive to re-think public sector commissioning to target individual wards and set clear and deliverable targets for commissioners working in partnership rather than in isolation. In east London there is a huge opportunity provided by the potential merger within the acute sector of Barts and the Royal London with Whipps Cross and Newham General hospitals. By delivering this and striking the right relationship with the other hospitals in east London, and with public health and social care systems moving closer together and commissioning reorganised into much larger groupings, there would be something like a single health system for northeast London. If all decisions were then genuinely to be taken in the interests of patients rather than institutions, the revolution might be started and in 2012!<\/p>\n<p>The three inner east London boroughs are now blessed with able elected Mayors. This provides a further potential for cooperation across the difficult and often ill-defined administrative boundaries of social care, housing and health. Long-term poverty cannot be eliminated and attacked on all fronts at the same time. We should begin at the beginning and try to give a real life chance to those who are newborn or at pre-school age. A successful programme imported from Canada, called the Family Nurse Partnership, has been trialled in Tower Hamlets and we now need to build this across east London as part of a real Olympic legacy. It teaches parenting skills and supports new and chaotic parents throughout those difficult early years leading on to a full support system for the children through schooling and into a decent job. The latter part of the programme is supported by the Mayor\u2019s (Boris Johnson\u2019s) Fund for London with a number of big private sector players providing the cash.<\/p>\n<p>The correlation between unemployment and bad health is well documented and it is increasingly clear that, after generations of government training provision for those on the long-term register, little has been achieved in east London. Alumni of employability schemes know that generalised training rarely leads to a decent job. Top quality training run by the public sector for known jobs in the public sector in east London would almost certainly lead to much better outcomes. It would have the added benefit of helping public sector agencies understand the needs of their local communities much better and then to angle service provision much more accurately.<\/p>\n<p>Finally we need to commission our local services very differently. Most of them are emanations of politically driven programmes in Whitehall and are very blunt instruments. Poverty is very unevenly distributed at the local level as the Tower Hamlets example shows. We need to target needy wards and housing estates much more accurately and only local knowledge can do this. An alternative would be to ask the local authority, the NHS and the Metropolitan Police to define the problem and them jointly commission known local providers to deliver and assess the outcomes.<br \/> Delivered together these three programmes, including a consolidated health system for northeast London, the Family Nurse Partnership and locally targeted employment solutions, would provide a lasting legacy for east Londoners, transforming lives as well as eliminating health inequalities.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/11\/2011_chw_5090_OBrien.pdf","article_publishing_date":"November 2011","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"137","name":"Stephen","created":"2011-11-04 11:46:17","modified":"2013-03-11 16:44:19","slug":"obrien-stephen","family_name":"O'Brien","title":"Sir","email_address":"","photo_legacy":"","profile_text":"<p>Stephen O'Brien is chairman of Barts Health NHS Trust and vice-president of Business in the Community.<\/p>","organization":"","role":"","additional_affiliations":"","qualifications":"","staff_pages_blurb":"","office_location":"","display_after":"","display_until":"","extended_blurb":"","special_2012ec_blurb":"","special_2012ec_affiliation":"","special_2013rio_blurb":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb_lang2":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation_lang2":null,"phone_number":null}],"attachments":false,"gallery":{"slug":false,"extra_classes":"","slides":[]}},{"request_language":"","current_page_uri":"\/media\/search-dev.json","lang2_slug":false,"lang2_name":false,"parent_publication_id":5,"featured_image_uri":"","article_title":"East: Olympics \/ Lower Lea","permalink":"east-olympics-lower-lea","article_subtitle":"Accommodating Growth or Conflict?","article_abstract":"","article_summary":"","article_text":"<p>The London Olympic Games in 2012 will be one of the main catalysts of social, physical and environmental change in the wider London Thames Gateway.

The new city of 15 million or more people, like Shanghai, S\u00e3o Paulo, Mumbai, or Mexico City, has transformed the politics, economics, infrastructure and culture of everyday existence. Yet, as in the past, urbanites now have two basic desires: they want cities that are efficient, and they want cities full of life.<\/p>\n<p>The need for efficiency comes into conflict constantly with the desire for sociability. The quest for efficiency aims at balance and harmony. Sociability in cities involves complex mixtures of people with diverging interests; they have to negotiate their relationships day by day, and the results are messy.<\/p>\n<p>The distinction between efficient and sociable is particularly acute for a huge class of people to whom urbanists seem indifferent. This is the class that is neither poor nor bourgeois, the <em>classes moyens<\/em>, as French sociologists call them, or the lower-middle-class in English terms: small shopkeepers and salesmen, clerks and other low-level bureaucrats, skilled manual labourers. These are the people for whom efficiency means a safer, healthier environment than that of the dramatically poor. But they are just on the edge of experiencing a better-quality life; the spectre of poverty, which is just below them, which they may have just left, is haunting. This is the life evoked by Louis-Ferdinand C\u00e9line in the novel <em>Voyage au Bout de la Nuit<\/em> [Journey to the End of the Night], or by Truffaut&#8217;s film <em>Les Quatre Cents Coups<\/em> [The 400 Blows]. The experience of an efficient and workable everyday life feels fragile. Class consciousness puts those two words, efficient and fragile, together.<\/p>\n<p>The sociability bred of this fragility is often hostile to those both above and below, and inward-turning. Sociologists label this kind of outlook <em>ressentiment<\/em>, a combination of resentment and withdrawal, and it possesses a right-wing political sting; numerous studies show that <em>ressentiment<\/em> animates racial prejudices, hostility to immigrants. <em>Ressentiment<\/em> is not urbane. And literally so, groups motivated by this passion have, as Michel de Certeau has documented, practised an intensely local form of excluding those below. But I&#8217;m convinced that it is not inevitable for people newly emerged from poverty, or living a cut above it. The physical conditions in which the <em>classes moyennes<\/em> live can orient people in a different, more positive, more integrated way.<\/p>\n<p>As a visitor to Rio de Janeiro, I have been struck by how much of the city belongs to the <em>classes moyennes<\/em>. Particularly due to the growth of this class in recent years, poor people have moved just one or two steps up if they exit poverty \u2013 just as was the case in New York a century ago in boroughs like Queens and the Bronx, or today in the expansion of North-West Shanghai. Given the peculiar fabric of Rio, an archipelago of different socio-economic communities, the issue of integration is particularly difficult in terms of city planning. I am no expert on Rio, but I&#8217;d like to offer some ideas about how a more integrated approach could join efficiency to sociability.<\/p>\n<h2>The Edge Condition<\/h2>\n<p>Integration happens at the edges between communities. Urbanists have in general been very bad at creating edges of the \u2018open\u2019 sort; instead, the great urban growth spurt of recent decades has strengthened segregation. This is true not only of gated residential communities, but of places to work or consume \u2013 the office campus, the shopping mall \u2013 which are mono-functional in character. Segregation of function has become the planner&#8217;s yardstick of efficiency.<\/p>\n<p>Edges come in two forms: the boundary and the border. Rigid controls over movement from country to country are meant to enforce the boundary condition, while the Schengen arrangements in Europe, for example, are meant to create more open borders between its member states. At the urban level, motorways create boundaries between communities, while spine-streets create more open borders. A more provocative distinction is the difference between a cell wall and a cell membrane. A cell wall serves mainly to conserve vital ingredients within the cell, while a membrane functions to exchange ingredients between a cell\u2019s in- and outside. But the membrane is not, as it were, an open door; this edge is both porous and resistant, that is, it both admits new matter and also resists loss of its own substance.<\/p>\n<p>Porosity and resistance combined tell something about the concept of integration, a concept all-important in urban planning. Too often, well-meaning planners confuse integration with erasure, a clearing flat of urban space, destroying traces of the past, leaving no physical markers of difference in the present. This is the story of much urban renewal in twentieth-century North American cities, and twenty-first century cities in China. Erasure does not stimulate integration, on the contrary; the result, in Shanghai as much as Chicago, has left people, particularly in the <em>classes moyennes<\/em>, feeling exposed and vulnerable.<\/p>\n<p>An alternative way to create a living edge is embodied in the work that urbanists did on the reconstruction of Beirut after its long civil war ended in the 1990s. The &#8216;green line&#8217; in the city was a zone where warring Christians and Muslims had fought each other for 14 years; by the war&#8217;s end, it had reverted to trees and weeds. The planners made use of this natural resurgence to carve out a shaded market extending along the line of former combat; the buildings on either side were left to local or family development. The market structures were themselves temporary constructions, quickly put up or taken down. People out shopping could mix with their former enemies, but as easily recoil and withdraw. Such an uneasy truce exemplifies the urban membrane, which was both porous and resistant. Admittedly this was an extreme case, but the membrane logic is a good one, and urbanists should apply it to more ordinary urban scenes. Could it apply in Rio, for instance, to the relations between the <em>favelas<\/em> and surrounding neighbourhoods?<\/p>\n<h2>Complex Public Space<\/h2>\n<p>Our received notions of public space are one reason membrane creation has failed. The design of good urban space is an endless subject, which has preoccupied me my entire professional life. I want to focus just on one aspect, one which relates to mono-functional and multiple-function spaces. In principle, an overlay of functions creates public space: the thicker the collage of functions, the more public a space becomes. To understand why this is so, we might contrast the agora of ancient Athens to modern Times Square in New York.<\/p>\n<p>The agora, a six-hectare (nearly 15 acres) open space, contained all the elements of Athenian civic life in plain sight. The ancient Athenian visiting his banker at a table set out in the agora could see and hear the proceedings of a court of justice occurring in the same space, separated only by a low wall; if so minded he could shout out his own comment on the accused while counting his money. Several small shrines and a temple lining the agora permitted him to pray if the spirit moved him; he could dine and flirt in several private rooms whose doors gave directly onto the agora. Not only was this public space multi-functional, it was ambiguously defined, the edges between activities more borders rather than boundaries; the Athenian was constantly obliged to interpret what was happening in the agora.<\/p>\n<p>Modern Times Square in New York on the other hand does not require that effort of interpreting. It has become pure tourist space, which is to say, its recent \u2018renewal\u2019 development has made the centre of New York&#8217;s central public space mono-functional, devoted to tourists serviced by cheap hotels and restaurants, and, of course, popular theatres. There are other sorts of commercial and civic activities near Times Square, but they are out of sight, occurring within heavily-guarded buildings. Few native New Yorkers frequent Times Square: it has become a void at the heart of the city.<\/p>\n<p>The recipe for a live public realm in cities is more complicated than might first appear. Multiple functions generate ambiguity. Ambiguity requires interpretation. Interpretations are unstable in time. This recipe requires much unpacking. I simply want to stress that a live public space is not efficient, if we think of efficiency as a steady-state condition.<\/p>\n<h2>Quality of Life<\/h2>\n<p>I have touched on a number of principles of urban integration, in edges and public space. They stimulate exchange at the borders between territories, and they engage people in experiencing and interpreting complexity. These principles have a particular application to the fabric of ordinary life \u2013 that is, to people who are neither wealthy nor impoverished. They secure the quality of life by supplying, as it were, rules of engagement. They provide positive, sociable orientations to the city for people who may feel that class-bound kind of fragility that results in <em>ressentiment<\/em>.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":"","article_publishing_date":"October 2013","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"23","name":"Richard","created":"2011-10-04 13:06:04","modified":"2014-04-08 17:47:21","slug":"sennett-richard","family_name":"Sennett","title":"","email_address":"","photo_legacy":"","profile_text":"Richard Sennett is Professor of Sociology, LSE and University Professor of the Humanities, New York University.","organization":"LSE Cities, London School of Economics and Political Science","role":"Chair of the Advisory Board","additional_affiliations":"Professor of Sociology, London School of Economics and Political Sciences\nUniversity Professor of the Humanities, New York University","qualifications":"","staff_pages_blurb":"Richard Sennett is a sociologist and Professor of Sociology at the London School of Economics and Political Sciences, and University Professor of the Humanities at New York University.

The car, which is clearly a thing rather than an idea, was meant to offer personal mobility, rather than lead to the emergence of out-of-town shopping, toxic air pollution and traffic jams. The standard shipping container, also a thing, was meant to speed up loading, cut down handling costs and pilfering. It did all that, but, rather more visibly, it also wiped out every up stream dock, wharf and warehouse in the world, and eventually resulted in Canary Wharf becoming London\u2019s second financial centre. The three-electrode vacuum tube, or thermionic valve as it is known in the United States, was developed as a switch and an amplifier. It has done more than either the car or the shipping container to change the urban world. It has put electricity to work.<\/p>\n<p>As for ideas: there are the obvious ones, from the obvious sources. The urban theorists who believed in zoning, the modernists, who wanted a tabula rasa, and the followers of the picturesque, such as Camillo Sitte, who understood the city as a work of art. But there are also the kind of ideas that are less immediately obvious in their relevance to the nature of a city, but which may have the biggest impact in the long term. These might include the legal codes that result in certain kinds of leases, the political ideas about participation or centralisation that impact on how decisions about what to build, and what not to build are taken. And the fuel subsidies that may encourage one form of transport over another, and thus favour some forms of urbanism over others. All of these are ideas that are perhaps just as responsible for the way in which our cities work as the things that we use to make them, and to move around in them. But perhaps because things are more visible than ideas, and because we have grown increasingly suspicious of big ideas about cities, we have concentrated perhaps too much on the way we use things rather than on thinking about their effects and their potentials.<\/p>\n<p>Electricity is both an idea, and a thing. As a result it has had an unusually pervasive grip on our attitudes towards urbanism. It has not always been the same idea. For Benjamin Franklin, electricity was about understanding the nature of natural phenomena. Earlier scientists found that they could use electricity to give the appearance of resurrection to dead frogs. For over a century, electricity seemed closer to sorcery or magic than to production. It was only at the end of the nineteenth century that it began to offer solid industrial applications, and to start to shape cities. Electricity morphed from the valve to the transistor, and then the semi-conductor, triggering the digital revolution that quickly put paid to the analogue world. The digital revolution could be understood as the culmination of the electric age. From wireless connection to GPS navigation, it certainly seems to be offering what looks very much like magic. <\/p>\n<p>As an idea, electricity is what the Soviet Union promised to adopt as the road to the future. Elsewhere, out of the grip of the totalitarians, electricity was the inspiration that showed a way forward out of the age of steam and heavy machinery. The dams built by the Tennessee Valley Authority offered electrification as the new-deal escape from poverty. The steam-age city was soot streaked, and smog bound. It depended for its mobility, its factories, and for its comfort on the begrimed stokers confined below ground and below deck whose back-breaking toil fed the boilers. Electricity seemed as far removed from this sweat-soaked reliance on muscle power as the digital economy now is from the analogue. Some electric power might still depend on coal-fired power stations, but they are out of sight, and out of mind. At the point of delivery electricity seemed as if it were clean, manageable, and efficient.<\/p>\n<p>In the early twentieth century, electricity as celebrated by the Futurists was equated with effortless power, with city streets blazing with light, and with an irreversible break with the past. Electricity made the city more connected, metaphorically as well as literally. The endless city can be understood as a force field, its energy crackling over huge areas of apparently unconnected fragments of urban tissue, and connecting them. It is notable in this context to remember that the London Underground map of 1931 owes its graphic language to an electric circuit diagram: not so much a metaphor as a tactical way of making sense of the navigation of a complex system. <\/p>\n<p>Electricity was always a thing too. A thing that has had a massive impact on the form and density of cities. Otis lifts, streetlights, tramlines, air conditioning, neon and escalators changed the face of the first industrial metropolises. Berlin, London, New York and Chicago as they are today would not be possible without electricity. And not only in the physical sense, but in their political organisation too. For better or worse, electricity made possible the technology that sidestepped literacy, and allowed politicians to speak directly to the masses eighty years ago. There is nothing new about the impact of technology on civic strife, whatever the claims made for Blackberry-fuelled mayhem in the streets of London\u2019s Hackney and Haringey last year, or of Twitter in the Arab spring. If Hitler\u2019s rise to power was aided by his skill as a radio broadcaster, it was also the transistor radios in the backpacks of the French conscripts in Algeria that allowed them to hear De Gaulle\u2019s order to them to disobey their mutinous officers and so put down their attempt at a coup.<\/p>\n<p>In the last two to three decades we have been overwhelmed by the impact of all the things that electricity makes possible, without perhaps the perspective to go on seeing electricity as an idea. It is in part because we have lost the ability to be impressed or charmed by speculations about the nature of the future. The fading appeal of the Expo movement demonstrates the sense of ennui that we have acquired in speculations about the future and the place of technology in it. The Expo was once the most elaborate prototype for urban innovation. Joseph Paxton\u2019s prefabricated Crystal Palace, covering an awesome 800,000 square feet (74,322 m<sup>2<\/sup>) haunted the imagination of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Subsequently the Expo became a much less inspiring arena in which Robert Moses met Walt Disney, and where urban theory collided with popular culture. From the first Paris Exposition to the Brussels Expo of 1959, from the City Beautiful of Chicago to the starry-eyed futurism of New York in 1939, from the welfare state optimism of the Festival of Britain in 1951 to the grim corporate vision of New York in 1964, each of the fairs sloganised a particular view of urbanism that grew progressively more banal.<\/p>\n<p>The live TV broadcast was introduced to America at the World\u2019s Fair. Norman Bel Geddes designed Futurama, the enormous General Motors display that proudly declared itself the city of tomorrow with its 500,000 scale-model buildings and its one million trees and 50,000 cars, 10,000 of which actually moved. They were exhibits that opened the way for Robert Moses to start driving expressways through the Bronx, and demolishing swathes of Manhattan. In 1964 New York staged a second Expo, once more under the direction of Robert Moses. Walt Disney offered his services to several of the big commercial exhibitors, and afterwards he returned the compliment. He hired William Potter, one of Moses\u2019s aides at the 1964 fair, to offer guidance on his own plans to build a city. Together they worked on Epcot, the Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow, which, to judge by Disney\u2019s ambitions, was mooted as a direct answer to Jane Jacobs\u2019 anxieties about the future of the city. \u2018There will be no slum areas, because we will not let them develop. There will be no landowners, and therefore no voting control. People will rent houses, instead of buying them, and at a modest rental, there will be no retirees, everyone must be employed.\u2019 We recoiled, or, worse, we sniggered at what dreaming about the future had been reduced to if Epcot was what it had become. If the Expo has declined into senility, it is all the more important to find ways to understand the impact of the electric city, not just as a deluge of things, but in its significance for our notion of what the city can be. We are far too dependent now on electricity to be able to do without it.<\/p>\n<p>In less developed urban societies, the installation of electric street lighting, and the sense of security it brings at night to previously threatening streets, is still an early signal of infrastructure investment, and the maturity that comes with it. Despite the breezy way with which we continue to take the efficacy of Moore\u2019s Law for granted, and assume that computing power will continue to double every year or two, for a halving of the cost, the developed world cannot take it for granted that the lights will always stay on. Britain\u2019s reluctance to face the challenge of building a new generation of power plants, and German anathema to nuclear power are just two examples of the vulnerability of modern economies to electricity shortages. India\u2019s massive power cuts in the last year are another reminder that the future for the BRIC nations is also problematic.<\/p>\n<p>To explore the idea of the electric city offers a powerful way of understanding urbanism as it is being reshaped. Using the word at all involves looking back at ideas about the future, which belong to a historical moment less jaded than our own. It is to take a perspective that has not been desensitised by decades of technological innovation, so rapid, and so relentless that we have lost the ability to wonder, or even be surprised about what it has to offer.<\/p>\n<p>Electricity made the key elements of the modern city possible in successive technological generations. Early on it was the metro system. More recently it was the Internet. The impact of what electricity brought into being has changed fundamentally the geography of the city, and the way we live in it, and the way in which we interact with each other. Now we need to see what it can offer for the near future. It can encourage both anti-urban developments, and their antithesis. We need to find ways in which to emphasise the latter at the expense of the former. Electricity has made new spaces, both physical and virtual, possible. It has powered technologies that have shaped the grain of life in the city. The electric city could be taken to mean a city policed by number-plate recognition systems, kept moving by car-share schemes, and crowd monitoring on the underground network, and Oyster cards that track every journey taken on every bus and metro line in a city.<\/p>\n<p>The electric city that they delineate is both infinitely more transparent and more opaque than urbanism in its more traditional form. An electric city is a city of rippling neon and LEDs at night. An electric city is one that that is continually surveyed by surveillance cameras, a city navigated by GPS systems that make London taxi drivers\u2019 painstakingly acquired knowledge as nostalgically useless as the vinyl record some of us cannot bear to discard. The city\u2019s anonymity and privacy are under threat as never before from Google\u2019s cameras, Apple\u2019s location-based services and pervasive security. The iPhone leaves an indelible trail, and so do the Oyster card and the cash machine. This is turning the city into a compound in which every action is known, every form of behaviour can be predicted, every dissident suppressed. <\/p>\n<p>The way in which we navigate and socialise has been transformed. So has the way in which crime, politics and consumption work. The discouraging thing about almost every new technology is how what begins as radical and empowering so quickly turns into part of the apparatus, if not of repression then of consumerism. In urbanistic terms, if the impact of electricity powered digital development is to undermine the physical city, the Internet, which, like all authentic cities has both its light, and its dark side, must step up to the plate, and stand in as the new public realm. Crime and vice hover at the edges of virtual space that also encompasses the great free library that is Wikipedia, the explosion of online archives, and the market stalls that are open source designs. It has become a polyglot mix of the inspirational and the banal. Meanwhile, Twitter is the twenty-first-century equivalent of the lavatory wall, a place for the scurrilous and the anonymous to leave their mark, combined, if we are being generous, with an electronic version of the posters on Beijing\u2019s democracy wall. <\/p>\n<p>Electricity has transformed our distribution systems, and working practices. If we have no need to work in an office, we are never really out of it now. We have no need for record shops, no need for bookshops soon, and no need for post offices. But there is plenty of call for big out-of-town sheds for distribution. All the things that people have been speculating about for a couple of decades have happened. John Lewis set about making a real investment in e-commerce only two years ago. In that time it has grown to represent \u00a31 in every \u00a35 it takes at its tills. Why would it think about the investment in bricks and mortar that a department store with the same turnover as its online sales would need? Christopher Bailey\u2019s fashion shows for Burberry are now instantly streamed across the globe: no need then for a front-row seat in the tent when you can watch on your smart phone in a bar, or on a beach.<\/p>\n<p>Does the impact of immateriality of the electric city in the end undermine the essence of urbanism, or reinforce it? The electric city offers the possibility of feedback loops, and of making political and technical decisions in real time. It is both an echo chamber for the global village idiot, and a genuinely liberating and empowering phenomenon. But for it to remain a positive force, we cannot turn into passive consumers.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":"","article_publishing_date":"December 2012","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"1","name":"Deyan","created":"2011-08-23 13:50:55","modified":"2013-10-23 12:14:25","slug":"sudjic-deyan","family_name":"Sudjic","title":"","email_address":"","photo_legacy":"\/0_images\/02-DSudjic.jpg","profile_text":"<p>Deyan Sudjic is the Director of the Design Museum in London.

His words are still reason for pause for thought. Cities do not end at their municipal limits, and, in fact, they often spread out over regions. This is significant, especially because people who interact with each other, face to face in business districts, universities or city centres, often commute on regional scales. CEOs seldom live on their companies\u2019 doorsteps. These kinds of cities are constructed from a kaleidoscope of places and experiences. A city\u2019s diversity, the activities that take place within it, and the mutual relationships between its inhabitants often determine that city\u2019s strengths or weaknesses. A city is not only morphology: it is also about connections and spatial structures. Strong cities have energy, which cannot be attributed to the actions of local government. Yet, government has an important role to play in engendering such energy. The task is to determine what kind of governance philosophy would fit such a city, to generate a new form of energetic urban society.<\/p>\n<p>The resolution of big issues is conventionally thought to require large government decisions. In this case, however, thinking big may not be the answer to today\u2019s problems. We have left the era of Le Corbusier behind. For the twenty-first century, the strength of the city must be sought in new relationships between government, citizens and the business community. All too often, government agencies alienate themselves from citizens, taking the moral high ground and intervening in a top-down manner. <\/p>\n<p>In the \u2018energetic society\u2019, city governments can make more and better use of the energy embedded within a society, shaping its policies through positive and negative incentives, and setting medium- and long-term public goals. Sustainability is one such goal. Between now and 2030, the world must find a way of decoupling human welfare from the use of the earth\u2019s resources and its environmental effects. The relationship between the residential environments and global issues is abundantly clear to anyone tracing the origins of our food, transportation or home furnishings. The urban hinterland covers the globe and includes a huge variety of services, goods, materials, as well as flows of money, people and information. Every day container ships from around the world enter the port of Rotterdam to deliver flat screens, smartphones and the latest fashion items to cities and surrounding areas. The production and distribution of food, for example, involves a meticulously planned global logistics chain. Our daily lives are local in perception, but global if we take the logistics of production, use of resources and resulting emissions into account. Both citizens and public administrators seem to realise that liveable, clean cities are likely to be the champions of the future; not only because of the size of their share in the use of physical resources, but also because cultural change must begin within cities, in order to continue along the road we are on. <\/p>\n<p>The fossil fuel era will not end because of a lack of coal, just as the Stone Age did not end because people ran out of stones. Literature on \u2018the history of the environment\u2019 shows that major breakthroughs were often attributed to a reorientation of values, with city dwellers always playing an important role. Such shifts in values can be seen today in societies where citizens want to generate their own power, and where companies that base their business cases on green operational models are the leaders and frontrunners in their field. However, government policy is lagging behind. When urban civil society adopts these new values, a new perspective on the future of cities will emerge.<\/p>\n<p>Just as \u2018high carbon\u2019 could soon become synonymous with \u2018high risk\u2019, conversely a low-carbon profile could boost a city\u2019s image. The idea of a liveable, innovative city with a good air quality that makes efficient use of increasingly expensive resources is a visible leitmotiv for many urban administrators. But even so, the question is how to harness the energetic city to achieve a sustainable world. The answer will not come from large-scale governance delivering a masterplan, but will require individual administrators channelling societal energy in the right direction.<\/p>\n<p>A society of well-educated and articulate citizens places large demands on public administration. Attempts to \u2018capture and store\u2019 CO2 emissions underground in empty gas fields, has proven difficult and controversial in the Dutch town of Barendrecht, and the main reason is that its citizens were treated as if they were objects. The debate was framed in technological terms, with little consideration for their desires and fears. This emphasis on technology is also apparent in the thinking around sustainable cities. Solutions that regard the inhabitants of cities as objects are likely to be met with resistance, irrespective of whether those solutions come from a top-down government, or from a top-down technocratic perspective. Moreover, around 70 per cent of European cities that will be in existence in 2050 are already here. Over the coming decades they will merely be expanded or retrofitted to varying degrees. The main challenge facing these cities will be to improve and restructure existing urbanisation. With respect to the future, it will, therefore, be today\u2019s cities that lead us into the next phase.<\/p>\n<p>The examples show that the transition towards a sustainable society cannot be achieved by government decree or technology alone, and certainly not without the participation of urban citizens. Increasingly, citizens, businesses and local governments are taking the initiative, obtaining their information from online networks. A scenario in which public administration focuses on <em>governance<\/em>, instead of being a <em>government<\/em> agent, must be created through collaboration between citizens and government. Only then can both parties approach each other in a positive way, resolving disagreements and facing challenges such as urban agriculture, local energy generation, and the setting of climate-neutral goals. In the business community this can be observed in the strategic reorientation of companies like DSM, Unilever, Tesco and the Van Gansewinkel Groep. The key feature of these initiatives is the evident shift in values, not the change in CO2 emission levels. These changes put the government into a somewhat awkward position; society, in these cases, is more involved in the complex difficult transition than the government itself. Although this concerns only a small part of society, it could also present an opportunity for policy to play a role.<\/p>\n<p>A recent report by the Dutch government on \u2018The Energetic Society\u2019 states that government currently does not utilise all of the creativity and learning capacities present within society. Concepts such as \u2018Empowered Deliberative Democracy\u2019 (EDD) and \u2018information society\u2019 give a new perspective on the political and institutional dimension of the energetic society. EDD was developed as a concept in 2001 to describe the innovative ways in which governments can utilise the energy and impact of ordinary citizens to achieve institutional reform. Combining everyday practice with communication, responsibility and deliberation, it extends beyond abstract issues (such as conflicting values, justification) and focuses on concrete issues (such as repairing potholes, improving schools and managing nature reserves). One of the basic principles of EDD is to focus on specific, tangible problems, the engagement of ordinary citizens and public administrators at a local level, and to jointly search for solutions to those problems. The technical possibilities offered by Web 2.0 to create two-way communication, as well as the increase of information available, provide the right circumstances for hands-on involvement of articulate citizens and companies in formulating sustainability and local environmental policies.<\/p>\n<p>Urban citizens within the energetic society also create new structures themselves \u2013 by calling on the government to take responsibility, by focusing attention on tangible problems, and by searching for solutions through deliberation. In such cases, existing rules can hinder the development of new, previously unimagined and unconventional forms of collaboration, particularly in the field of energy. Surplus heat can, for example, be used to heat houses, flat school roofs can provide space for solar panels that generate power for their neighbourhood, and PV installations are cheaper when they are bought and installed in bulk. However, citizens are discouraged from collaborating in these unconventional ways by rules and costs, such as higher taxation on small-scale consumption, which become barriers to using innovative social sources of energy. <\/p>\n<p>The twenty-first century may very well see a return to spruced up versions of former social forms of collaboration, such as cooperatives and societies \u2013 citizens\u2019 associations, focused on incorporating sustainability into their own local environments. People who want to generate their own power, or grow their own food, are becoming united and can now make use of the knowledge and experience available on the Internet. In San Francisco, if you consider installing PV panels to your home, you can analyse costs and benefits through a website using aerial photos to estimate the size of your roof surface, after which a database will provide information on local regulations and the procedures to be followed. Should you wish to do so, you could unite with your neighbours online, and jointly purchase such solar systems (see http:\/\/1bog.org; http:\/\/zonability.com). The same applies to urban agriculture, where citizens worldwide share their knowledge and experience of innovative techniques to grow vegetables indoors, using hydro-culture techniques (see www.rndiy.org; www.windowfarms.org) and exchange practical knowledge on how to start a temporary farm on a patch of wasteland (see http:\/\/enablingcity.com\/). In these cases the government would just have to stand back and watch, doing what they find most difficult: do as little as possible. Citizens must be given the opportunity to get organised, and, together with public administrators, search for solutions. Only then would the energetic information society function properly. <\/p>\n<p>The core challenge for the energetic city is sustainability. Citizens and administrators are already involved in this, each in their own way. Companies consider sustainability in terms of financial returns and investment security. Multinationals consider the greening of cities, including new infrastructure, as one of the major investment opportunities of the future. Governments would do well to recognise both the value and risks of this energy, and to distinguish the physical from the cultural dimension. A clean economy is feasible, but it implies far-reaching adjustments. <\/p>\n<p>The use of resources and emission levels of greenhouse gases, such as CO2, should be around five times lower than they are today. This requires government to take on a large role, starting with the commitment to seriously address the issue, by using effective, traditional tools such as pricing and regulation, and especially by identifying new revenue models. But cultural shifts need to take place as well. Initiatives taken by citizens, businesses and local administrators on their own may be insufficient to find solutions to the big problems of climate change, but they are indispensable components in reassessing the economy and the thinking on welfare and well-being. Without these cultural changes, reducing the burden on the environment and natural resources by a factor of five will be impossible. <\/p>\n<p>Jointly, these initiatives within society can help create a widely shared vision of a new, stronger one. A smart, social and sustainable city creates an attractive image. Cities and the Internet, at both the local and global level, together are the breeding ground for ideas and shared visions of a sustainable society. However, to achieve the required 80 to 95 per cent reductions, we need both a local government that encourages and loosens the reins and a national government that helps to scale up promising initiatives and enables their widespread implementation.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"<p>The authors are members of PBL, the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency.

Between 1993 and 2011, the share of renewable energy in Germany\u2019s electricity mix increased from 3.9% to 20.3%.<\/p>\n<p><em>All variables are indexed: 1993=100.<\/em><br \/>\n<\/section>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":"","article_publishing_date":"December 2012","article_tags":false,"article_authors":false,"attachments":false,"gallery":{"slug":false,"extra_classes":"","slides":[]}},{"request_language":"","current_page_uri":"\/media\/search-dev.json","lang2_slug":false,"lang2_name":false,"parent_publication_id":7,"featured_image_uri":"","article_title":"Feeling the Urban Age","permalink":"feeling-the-urban-age","article_subtitle":"","article_abstract":"","article_summary":"","article_text":"","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":"http:\/\/v0.urban-age.net\/0_downloads\/Berlin_Ricky_Burdett_2006-Feeling_the_Urban_Age.pdf","article_publishing_date":"November 2006","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"53","name":"Ricky","created":"2011-10-11 21:01:44","modified":"2014-02-04 12:29:29","slug":"burdett-ricky","family_name":"Burdett","title":"","email_address":"r.burdett@lse.ac.uk","photo_legacy":"","profile_text":"Ricky Burdett is Professor of Urban Studies and Director of LSE Cities.","organization":"LSE Cities, London School of Economics and Political Science","role":"Director","additional_affiliations":"Professor of Urban Studies, London School of Economics and Political Science Global Distinguished Professor, New York University","qualifications":"","staff_pages_blurb":"Ricky Burdett is Professor of Urban Studies, and director of LSE Cities and the Urban Age Programme.

Urban South America is quite another. The former is dominated by Mexico City, by far the largest city of the two entities with Miami as its other putative, though offshore, capital. Perhaps that\u2019s why South America is a construct that appeals to Brazil\u2019s boosters. Geographical fine-tuning allows S\u00e3o Paulo&#8217;s Metropolitan Region with 19 million people to make an unblushing claim to be the unchallenged leader, if not of Latin America, then at least of South America, of which it is indisputably the largest city.<\/p>\n<p>Even if S\u00e3o Paulo, for all its economic dynamism, sometimes suspects that it lags behind Mexico City \u2013 not just in size, but in its cultural and political clout \u2013 it is certainly way ahead of Rio de Janeiro. When Juscelino Kubitchek, Oscar Niemeyer\u2019s greatest patron, transferred his government to establish a new kind of country with Bras\u00edlia at its geographical heart, it was a huge political gesture. One unintended consequence was that it tilted the balance between the country\u2019s two largest cities even further towards S\u00e3o Paulo. Rio is now a place in which once languid embassies are hemmed in by angry favelas.<\/p>\n<p>But that sense of confidence and self assertion, marked by the building of Bras\u00edlia, is a reflection of the rather different status that South American cities have when compared with some of the other regions visited by Urban Age. By comparison with Shanghai, with its strongly centralist government, cities in South America display a much more sophisticated level of \u2018social entrepreneurship\u2019 and civic engagement. There, active pressure groups, religious, ethnic and political groups \u2013 in the wealthy districts as well as the highly organised favelas \u2013 are not beholden to central government. South America also has the benefit of civic initiatives that can pay off. Brazil has the example of Curitiba and beyond that, the work done by reforming mayors in Bogot\u00e1, a Metropolitan Area that with eight million people is far more relevant in terms of scale.<\/p>\n<p>In the last ten years, Bogot\u00e1 has built more than 50 new schools, a tangible investment in the quality of life of some of the city\u2019s poorest inhabitants. It has done a lot, not just to reduce truancy rates, but also to create a sense of inclusion. The city has initiated a vigorous programme to build new libraries, and an impressive public transport system based on special rapid transit bus lanes, which has succeeded in persuading commuters to leave their cars at home. Bogot\u00e1 has tackled crime through its visible commitment to social justice, bringing its murder rate down from frightening levels, and raising literacy in its overwhelmingly young population. Bogot\u00e1 shows its neighbours what can be done, given will, organisation, and rational priorities.<\/p>\n<p>In the network of South American cities, S\u00e3o Paulo certainly eclipses Buenos Aires, which, despite its nineteenth- century classical architecture and its European airs has still to regain the equilibrium of its time in the sun in the 1940s. Argentina\u2019s farmers are still angry enough with their government\u2019s economic policies to ignite the protest fires that left Buenos Aires trapped in a cloud of choking smoke last winter.<\/p>\n<p>Yet Brazil\u2019s huge size, and population in excess of 180 million, gives it a different urban pattern to that of its South American neighbours Argentina, Peru, and Colombia, who each have one overwhelmingly dominant city. One in every three Argentineans and Peruvians live in their capital cities compared to only one in every nine Brazilians who live in S\u00e3o Paulo. Lima&#8217;s dominance in Peru has virtually destroyed the national system of cities, a trend that was not even halted by the dismantling of Lima\u2019s public transport system in the early 1990s following the government\u2019s espousal of the most aggressive neo-liberal reforms in South America. Given the city\u2019s unique physical setting, constrained by mountains and the sea, and the absence of growth controls, Lima could develop into a 300 km long linear megacity that encroaches on adjacent low-value desert land; an unsustainable scenario in an environment where water supply and transport accessibility are already at their limits. S\u00e3o Paulo and Mexico City are very different models of what a city can be. Mexico City\u2019s roots go back far into the Pre-Colombian past. S\u00e3o Paulo was a tiny colonial outpost until the beginning of the last century. S\u00e3o Paulo is now the largest city in one of the world\u2019s most important new economies, representing the B in that uncomfortably named entity, BRIC, of which the other members are India, China and Russia.<\/p>\n<p>Brazil has the tenth largest market in the world, and an art biennale that has global clout. S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s GDP is in excess of US$ 10,000 per head, and it has 30,000 millionaires. It has an economy that has powered past that of Mexico, to become bracketed by booming India and Russia. A very large part of Brazil\u2019s economic strength can be ascribed to the extraordinary growth of S\u00e3o Paulo. It has exploded in size from just 240,000 people in the early years of the last century. Despite a recent slowdown in its economic prowess, it has been a job-creating machine, absorbing successive waves of migrants: from Europe and Japan, as well as from Brazil\u2019s poor North-East. By many measures, it is an unqualified success.<\/p>\n<p>And yet, it is a country and a city that cannot control crime. A year ago Brazil found itself unable to trust the safety of its skies and found itself paralysed by air traffic restrictions. The clich\u00e9s about S\u00e3o Paulo come thick and fast. It has more private helicopters registered to its citizens than any other city in the world. Its prison system is in a permanent state of insurgency. Its tribes of street children are brutalised both by crime and the police. It is also the city whose reforming Mayor reclaimed the public realm by banning outdoor advertising, leaving the ghostly traces of billboards stripped of their posters and the charred surfaces revealed by neon signs that have been dismantled. And it is a centre for media that has created the telenovella, spreading a very particular kind of Brazilian culture to audiences around the world.<\/p>\n<p>S\u00e3o Paulo is the classic second city, built on an industrial explosion from almost nothing. And it is that industrial base that makes the Brazilian economy different. It has moved far beyond the natural-resource based boom-and-bust cycles of its neighbours. S\u00e3o Paulo could have been a Manchester, a Shanghai, or a Chicago. But where Rio lost the will to work after it ceded its capital-city status to Bras\u00edlia, S\u00e3o Paulo is a second city that became a first city. Its infrastructure may be in a ramshackle state. Its crime really is an issue. But like Johannesburg, S\u00e3o Paulo has the vitality and drive that keeps it moving. S\u00e3o Paulo is an authentic metropolis with the racial diversity to prove it with a Japanese and an Arab quarter as well as a Balkan district.<\/p>\n<p>In urban and architectural terms, Brazil is still overshadowed by the remarkable generation that began by creating Rio\u2019s great Corbusian monument: the Ministry of Education. It may have lost the remarkable landmark building skills of Oscar Niemeyer. The remarkable architectural talent of Lino Bo Bardi, who arrived from Italy in S\u00e3o Paulo after World War II has not yet been overtaken by her successors. But in the shape of the Campana brothers S\u00e3o Paulo has developed its visibility as a centre for creative design.<\/p>\n<p>In urban terms the question that faces it is how to address the inequalities, and the fractured nature of its public services. If it does that it could yet find itself becoming a Tokyo, where prosperity and organisation overcame an equally random pattern of dizzyingly rapid growth.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":"http:\/\/v0.urban-age.net\/0_downloads\/archive\/_SA\/01_NewsPaper_Essay_Sudjic.pdf","article_publishing_date":"December 2008","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"1","name":"Deyan","created":"2011-08-23 13:50:55","modified":"2013-10-23 12:14:25","slug":"sudjic-deyan","family_name":"Sudjic","title":"","email_address":"","photo_legacy":"\/0_images\/02-DSudjic.jpg","profile_text":"<p>Deyan Sudjic is the Director of the Design Museum in London.

Since then, electricity has powered \u2013 directly or indirectly \u2013 the shape and dynamics of urban life. In cities of the developed world, we take for granted that electricity feeds the complex systems which sustain and sometimes spectacularly fail us. In emerging cities of the developing world, a light bulb is still embraced as a symbol of civilisation by some, while others celebrate their urbanity in a visual cacophony of neon. The Electric City is, in many ways, the crucible of patterns of production, consumption and pollution of the 21st century \u2018urban age\u2019 as cities struggle with their impact on the social and environmental well-being of the planet.<\/p>\n<p>After having tackled the urban economy, health and well-being, violence, security, social inclusion and design at conferences held in \u2013 amongst others \u2013 Hong Kong, Chicago, New York, S\u00e3o Paulo and Johannesburg, the Urban Age returns to London for its eleventh conference since 2005. We turn our attention to the challenges and responsibilities faced by cities in the digital age as Climate Change and economic pressures continue to define our everyday urban realities. Since its inception, the Urban Age has studied the spatial and social dynamics of over 30 cities in the developed and developing world, collaborated with over 40 academic institutions and municipal authorities and been attended by over 5,000 speakers and participants from urban design, policymaking, research and practice. <\/p>\n<p>In London we welcome over 60 speakers from 30 cities in 15 countries across four continents who take part in the two-day Urban Age Electric City conference in the aptly named Shoreditch Electric Light Station in central London \u2013 a building that in its own history reflects the connections between power and the city. It opened as an electricity generating station in 1896 to burn rubbish, giving steam for generating electricity with the waste used to heat public baths next door. The motto above the door is \u2018E Pulvere Lux Et Vis, or \u2018Out Of The Dust, Light And Power\u2019, reflecting a trajectory of sustainable resilience that parallels the themes and issues debated by the protagonists of the Urban Age.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":"","article_publishing_date":"December 2012","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"53","name":"Ricky","created":"2011-10-11 21:01:44","modified":"2014-02-04 12:29:29","slug":"burdett-ricky","family_name":"Burdett","title":"","email_address":"r.burdett@lse.ac.uk","photo_legacy":"","profile_text":"Ricky Burdett is Professor of Urban Studies and Director of LSE Cities.","organization":"LSE Cities, London School of Economics and Political Science","role":"Director","additional_affiliations":"Professor of Urban Studies, London School of Economics and Political Science Global Distinguished Professor, New York University","qualifications":"","staff_pages_blurb":"Ricky Burdett is Professor of Urban Studies, and director of LSE Cities and the Urban Age Programme.

The cities of Recife, Belo Horizonte and Rio de Janeiro were pioneers in these actions. In the following decade, with the success of these initiatives, such actions were spread across the country, driven by international funding agencies (IDB and IBRD) and by the Ministry of Cities.<\/p>\n<h1>Projeto Mutir\u00e3o (Joint Effort Project)<\/h1>\n<p>The institutionalization process of the urbanization work in slums began in Rio de Janeiro in 1981 with the creation of <em>Projeto Mutir\u00e3o<\/em> under the responsibility of the <em>Secretaria Municipal de Assist\u00eancia Social<\/em> (Municipal Department of Social Welfare). It provided technical assistance, building materials, tools and resources for hiring skilled labor to the slum residents\u2019 associations. With these inputs, the associations organized task forces to implement the paving of alleys, stairways, water and sewage networks and drainage systems, and eventually daycare facilities. All services were supervised by architects and engineers in the public service.<\/p>\n<h1>Programa Favela Bairro (Slum Improvement Program)<\/h1>\n<p>The city of Rio made a significant leap forward in the pattern of their interventions in the slums when it initiated the <em>Programa Favela Bairro<\/em> in 1994. Deployed at first as part of the city budget, it soon relied on external resources, through a loan agreement established with the Inter-American Development Bank. Under the focus of this new program, the urbanization works were no longer performed in an amateurish way, through joint efforts, and came to rely on the support of companies specializing in the design, management and construction contracted by public tender or bidding processes, and on a specialized institutional manager, the Municipal Department of Housing.<\/p>\n<p>The first action of the program was to hold a public tender of methodologies for slum upgrading projects promoted in partnership with the Rio de Janeiro Department of the Institute of Architects of Brazil \u2013 IAB\/RJ. In the first phase, 17 architecture firms were selected and hired to prepare projects for the first slums to benefit from the integrated works of urbanization. In total, 147 settlements were served by the <em>Programa Favela Bairro<\/em>, with a total population of 710,000 inhabitants. The program invested US$ 650 million in urbanization works, provision of social equipment, new housing and actions of social promotion, employment and income generation.<\/p>\n<p>The Favela Bairro was the most comprehensive program of integrated urbanization of slums in its time and has been a model of public policy replicated in several cities in Brazil and Latin America.<\/p>\n<h1>The PAC of the Slums<\/h1>\n<p>Beginning in the year 2007, the Brazilian Federal Government instituted the Growth Acceleration Plan (PAC) with the aim of boosting the national economy, having incorporated the urbanization of slums as one of its goals. To achieve this goal, the government created the &#8220;PAC of the slums&#8221;, providing US$ 5.8 billion for this action. Of this amount, US$ 0.85 Billion (12% of the total) was allocated to the city of Rio de Janeiro, which indicates the level of technical and methodological capacity achieved by the city and its employees, the result of continuous and evolutionary action in the urbanization actions of the slums.<\/p>\n<h1><em>Programa Morar Carioca<\/em> (Rio Living Program)<\/h1>\n<p><em>Morar Carioca<\/em> started in 2009, using all the experience acquired from the past initiatives, and with the hope of producing a relevant social and urban legacy resulting from major events on the city calendar, it took the bold challenge of urbanizing all city slums by the year 2020. In order to accomplish this goal, a new program of slum urbanization was initiated: the <em>Morar Carioca<\/em> \u2013 Municipal Program for the Integration of Substandard Informal Urban Settlements.<\/p>\n<p>After the goals were set, the foundations and guidelines of the new program were established, the scale, breadth and scope were redefined in relation to the previous experience (<em>Favela Bairro<\/em>). The interventions to be performed would no longer cover isolated slums but should cover clusters of neighboring slums where possible, encompassing a minimum of one thousand households. The diagnoses and proposals should also cover the formal interstitial urban fabric that exists between settlements, in order to promote a true urban integration of formal and informal areas.<\/p>\n<p>As in the <em>Favela Bairro<\/em>, the <em>Morar Carioca<\/em> also established the strategy of hiring architecture firms through the public tender of methodologies, conducted in partnership with the Institute of Architects of Brazil. Thus, 40 teams of architects were selected among the 86 that showed up for the event.<\/p>\n<p>Simultaneously with the preparation of the public tender, criteria were established for eligibility and prioritization of slums and\/or groups of slums to be benefited by the Program. The proximity of the settlements to the Olympic equipment or new transportation corridors (BRT) to be built in the city was taken as a relevant criterion for the choice. Such guidance was aimed at establishing a synergy between the investments made for the Olympic Games with the investments in the urbanization of the slums.<\/p>\n<p>The operation of the <em>Programa Morar Carioca<\/em> was established on the basis of an action plan put together by the technical staff of the Municipal Department of Housing, which determined a set of actions that are described and quantified in the table below:<\/p>\n<table>\n<colgroup> <\/colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><span>Cycles<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span>Settlements<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span>Homes (Census of 2010)<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span>Investments (jan.2012)<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span>Period of Execution<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span>Cycle 1<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span>68<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span>75,996<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span>US$ 1.05 Billion<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span>2010_2012<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span>Cycle 2<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span>218<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span>112,409<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span>US$ 1.90 Billion<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span>2013_2016<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span>Cycle 3<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span>300<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span>120,706<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span>US$ 1.85 Billion<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span>2017-2020<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span>Subtotal<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span>586<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span>309,111<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span>US$ 4.80 Billion<\/span><\/td>\n<td><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span>Settlements in Analysis<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span>141<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span>19,861<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span>US$ 1.20 Billion<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span>2010-2020<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span>Settlements &lt;100<br \/>\nhomes<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span>206<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span>13,838<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span>US$ 0.40 Billion<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span>2010-2012<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span>Totals<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span>933<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span>342,810<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span>US$ 6.40 Billion<\/span><\/td>\n<td><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p>Source: Municipal Department of Housing<\/p>\n<p>The territorial distribution is illustrated in the map below.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2013\/10\/four-decades-of-urbanization-of-slums_img01.jpg\"><img src=\"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2013\/10\/four-decades-of-urbanization-of-slums_img01-1024x697.jpg\" alt=\"four-decades-of-urbanization-of-slums_img01\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-5614\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Source: Municipal Department of Housing<\/p>\n<p>Due to several factors linked to local, national and international circumstances, it is impossible to effectively ensure that the goal of urbanization of all slums will be met by 2020.

The city has reduced methane emissions through intervention in the disposal of urban solid waste, mainly domestic rubbish. Unlike the irregular and extremely large outdoor lix\u00f5es, domestic waste in S\u00e3o Paulo is collected in landfills in environmentally protected areas which avoid human contamination or damage to the soil and ground water tables. The city operates two such solid waste landfills: Bandeirantes in the north-western part of the city, and S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o in the South-East. Each receives around 7,000 tons of domestic solid waste daily, in addition to the sludge generated through sewage from the state water company.<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Slow decomposition of organic matter present in the solid waste produces a biogas, rich in methane, which permeates the layers of material covering the landfills and is released into the atmosphere, thus contributing to the greenhouse effect. Here, a system for collecting, filtering, pressuring, and burning the gas in thermal electric plants prevents it from being released into the atmosphere. In addition, 80 per cent of the collected biogas is used to generate electrical power at electric plants located on site. By the end of 2008, seven per cent of households in S\u00e3o Paulo will be supplied by energy thus generated. The result is a twofold environmental gain: in addition to reducing the amount of methane released into the atmosphere, the need for new sources of energy is reduced.<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The Kyoto Protocol, which requires industrialised countries to meet targets for reduced emissions of greenhouse gases either within their own territory or through investment in developing countries, made this project possible. The United Nations Clean Development Mechanism, which granted S\u00e3o Paulo the carbon credits to sell to companies and institutions in countries seeking emission control targets, has in effect helped to fund environmental controls already in place in S\u00e3o Paulo.<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Today, the project\u2019s biogas control certification is equivalent to controls of 3,106,211 tons of carbon, a sum close to the total carbon credits generated by all the other certified projects in Brazil combined. With the highest landfill control certification in the world (1,150,144 tons), the Bandeirantes landfill generates the highest benefit percentage for the State of S\u00e3o Paulo: half the credits are sold at public international auctions to ensure transparency and the highest price for the city. Recently, purchase of S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s Certificates of Emission Reduction (CER) generated almost \u20ac 28 million for the city.<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">These proceeds are then invested in urban and environmental improvements to the areas surrounding the landfills \u2013 areas where their impact is directly experienced. The neighbourhoods of Perus and Pirituba in the North-West, and S\u00e3o Mateus and Sapopemba in the South-East, are receiving parks, public squares and other measures to control erosion and to improve access to quality space for the low-rent population living there. Public hearings organised by the municipal government allow for the direct participation of residents in the vetting of how and where to invest financial resources obtained from the sale of the CER.<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Additional credits and future auctions are expected to produce further social and physical improvements to the urban landscape, proving that the landfills are assets to be maintained, valued and utilised throughout their life span. This project is thus proving to be a safer and more economical solution than incineration plants. Even so, S\u00e3o Paulo will need to work with other prefeituras in the metropolitan area to implement and share new landfills at even more distant sites.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":"http:\/\/v0.urban-age.net\/0_downloads\/archive\/_SA\/08_NewsPaper_Essay_Goldenstein.pdf","article_publishing_date":"December 2008","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"8","name":"Stela","created":"2011-08-30 12:51:34","modified":"2011-08-30 14:43:46","slug":"stela","family_name":"Goldenstein","title":null,"email_address":null,"photo_legacy":null,"profile_text":"<p>Stela Goldenstein is the Deputy Chief of Staff for the S\u00e3o Paulo Municipality, and was formerly the Environment Secretary for the State and City of S\u00e3o Paulo.<\/p>","organization":"","role":"","additional_affiliations":null,"qualifications":null,"staff_pages_blurb":null,"office_location":null,"display_after":null,"display_until":null,"extended_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb_lang2":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation_lang2":null,"phone_number":null}],"attachments":false,"gallery":{"slug":false,"extra_classes":"","slides":[]}},{"request_language":"","current_page_uri":"\/media\/search-dev.json","lang2_slug":false,"lang2_name":false,"parent_publication_id":35,"featured_image_uri":"","article_title":"Global Problems: City Solutions","permalink":"global-problems-city-solutions","article_subtitle":"","article_abstract":"","article_summary":"","article_text":"<p>Cities have clearly played a major role in the creation of the problem of anthropogenic climate change and they will form a central part of any response. No effective global collaborative agreement to tackle climate change can be delivered without the full involvement of cities. Yet the evidence suggests that measures that make cities work better in terms of emissions and sustainability, are also measures that make them work better as prosperous and attractive places to live and work. <\/p>\n<p>Cities are well placed to lead the process of low-carbon innovation. They combine a mix of specialisation and diversity derived from a concentration of people and economic activity that generates a fertile environment for innovation in ideas, technologies and processes. They produce and distribute the resources that provide better livelihoods for urban and rural residents alike. Their size and economic complexity mean that city-specific problems such as congestion, waste, education and crime require considered, city-specific public intervention. At the same time high population density and compactness can allow for economics of scale and collaboration. <\/p>\n<p>Greenhouse gas emissions are directly related to income. Per capita incomes are generally higher in cities than in surrounding rural areas, generating higher average per capita demand related to major emissions sources. But not all cities are the same. There is an enormous variation in emissions among cities with similar per capita incomes as a result of local climatic conditions, their energy mixes and industry shares, as well as the extent to which they simply export their emissions. It is the last point that tends to make most developed world urban areas look far better than they actually are, as it ignores emissions linked to their material consumption and the embodied energy generation that occurs elsewhere. <\/p>\n<p>But emissions have also been associated with differences in settlement patterns, leading to an underlying tendency to lower average per capita emissions in denser, compacter cities. Consequently, even when appropriately acknowledging that cities are not self-sufficient entities and ought to share responsibility for carbon-intensive activities beyond their boundaries, some world metropolises seem to be relatively energy and carbon efficient, whether measured by unit output or per capita. Paris, S\u00e3o Paulo, London, Dhaka, Hong Kong and Tokyo have among the world\u2019s lowest levels of energy intensity \u2013 about one-quarter of that of the five highest scoring cities and less than half of the fifty-city average<a class=\"cite_ref\" id=\"cite_ref-1\" href=\"#cite_note-1\">1<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Cities with limited urban sprawl and integrated urban transit systems have in many cases become affluent with low emissions per head. Their relative resource efficiency is mainly a result of greater transport energy efficiency due to reduced distances and greater shares of green transport modes, greater heat and cooling energy efficiency in buildings, due to lower surface-to-volume ratios of compacter building methods, and lower embedded energy demand for urban infrastructure due to greater utilisation. But compact, well-managed cities with intelligent infrastructure can also be more attractive to footloose workers than suburban or rural communities. Inner-city Paris, Rome, Barcelona and London, together with New York, Singapore and Tokyo provide examples of creative, growing city centres with access to a variety of amenities, including green space. Dense cities tend to have lower per-capita emissions, provided they are also served by good public transport systems<a class=\"cite_ref\" id=\"cite_ref-2\" href=\"#cite_note-2\">2<\/a>. <\/p>\n<p>With shorter transport networks and less diffuse utility infrastructures, denser cities generate significant savings in operating costs, running to thousands of US$ per year for the average household<a class=\"cite_ref\" id=\"cite_ref-3\" href=\"#cite_note-3\">3<\/a>. But suburban living remains popular, so dense cities need to be carefully planned to attract wealth creating individuals who can choose other options. Without coordinated planning, cities will be at risk of \u2018locking in\u2019 to long-lived, high-carbon capital infrastructure that will be costly to reverse. Not surprisingly, cities that today are regarded as green leaders have a track record in long-term and integrated planning, particularly related to land use and public transport infrastructure.<\/p>\n<p>Implementing greenhouse gas reduction strategies can pay economic dividends beyond reduced risks of the great potential damage associated with climate change. It can drive efficiency and allow cities to reduce waste and cut costs. Cities offer a unique environment to innovate, develop and scale up new ideas and processes. These promote the growth of clusters of expertise in knowledge-intensive green production sectors. Cities have become laboratories for action on climate change where learning and experience induces further innovation and falling cost in new technologies. Integrated recycling networks, electric mobility based on renewable energy production, methane capture and combined heat and power have relied on ready access to new technologies and skilled engineers and installation experts, which are all easier to access in a compact urban environment. Scale economy benefits of urbanisation mean that cities can capitalise on developing \u2018green\u2019 investments, such as integrated public transit, sewers and water systems, congestion pricing, smart grids, smart buildings and decentralised energy networks<a class=\"cite_ref\" id=\"cite_ref-4\" href=\"#cite_note-4\">4<\/a>. According to some reports, urban regions already produce ten times more renewable technologies patents than rural regions<a class=\"cite_ref\" id=\"cite_ref-5\" href=\"#cite_note-5\">5<\/a>. <\/p>\n<p>Climate policy also yields mutual benefits at the local level, while investment in attractive and successful cities will yield climate benefits. Lower particulate pollution reduces health care costs, increases city attractiveness, and promotes competitiveness, while reduced waste makes for a more attractive environment (for example through reduced use of landfill) and enhanced energy security by limiting reliance on imported energy and raw materials<a class=\"cite_ref\" id=\"cite_ref-6\" href=\"#cite_note-6\">6<\/a>. This means policies must be well planned: for example, efficiently reducing congestion and emissions requires complementary measures on public transport, cycling, electric and shared vehicle infrastructure, urban planning, zoning and carbon pricing. During economic downturns, such programmes can boost job creation and stimulate activity, especially in \u2018shovel-ready\u2019 sectors such as building efficiency retrofits, broadband infrastructure and retooling manufacturing. Policies to increase vegetation and green spaces not only reduce the heat island effect, but also improve resilience to flooding. <\/p>\n<p>Implementing Bogot\u00e1\u2019s TransMilenio bus system was primarily motivated by an urgent need for cost-effective, high-capacity urban transport, congestion reduction and improving the quality of life locally rather than aiming to reduce global carbon emissions. However, this scheme has not only reduced emissions, it has shortened travel time and lowered congestion at peak times by 40 per cent<a class=\"cite_ref\" id=\"cite_ref-7\" href=\"#cite_note-7\">7<\/a>. Overall, health benefits in cities as a result of green transport strategies are particularly high as they combine emission reduction, increased physical activity levels and road safety. Health and safety benefits have been estimated as 5 to 20 times greater than the cost for integrated non-motorised and public transport measures in diverse cities such as Bogot\u00e1, Morogoro and Delhi<a class=\"cite_ref\" id=\"cite_ref-8\" href=\"#cite_note-8\">8<\/a> and these are in addition to the substantial benefits in terms of saving time and resources. <\/p>\n<p>Transport contributes around 22 per cent of the world\u2019s energy related greenhouse gas emissions. Of about ten billion trips that are made every day in urban areas around the world, a significant and increasing share is with carbon and energy intensive private motorised modes. Until now, many aspects of commuting and transport design have been wasteful and inefficient. Even within the European Union, a highly urbanised region with ambitious carbon reduction policies in place, transport-related CO<sub>2<\/sub> emissions increased by 36 per cent between 1990 and 2006, while other key sectors have achieved at least modest reductions<a class=\"cite_ref\" id=\"cite_ref-9\" href=\"#cite_note-9\">9<\/a>. In the UK, the cost of public transport relative to private transport has risen sharply over the past twenty years, compounding the waste from congestion. Congestion of roads in the UK causes estimated annual losses of around GB\u00a37 to 8 billion, around 0.5 per cent of the GDP (US$11 to 12.6 billion; \u20ac8.1 to 9.3 billion)<a class=\"cite_ref\" id=\"cite_ref-10\" href=\"#cite_note-10\">10<\/a>. Costs are even higher in developing countries with rapidly growing cities unable to catch up with population growth and motorisation. The costs of congestion in Buenos Aires are estimated at 3.4 per cent of local GDP, in Mexico City 2.6 and in Dakar 3.4 per cent<a class=\"cite_ref\" id=\"cite_ref-11\" href=\"#cite_note-11\">11<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Time losses, wasted energy, higher accident risks and the negative impact on the quality of life make a powerful case for strategies to reduce congestion. London\u2019s congestion charge reduced congestion by an estimated 30 per cent between February 2003 and February 2004, in comparison to the same period in previous years<a class=\"cite_ref\" id=\"cite_ref-12\" href=\"#cite_note-12\">12<\/a> and CO<sub>2<\/sub> emissions from traffic inside the charging zone were cut by 19.5 per cent<a class=\"cite_ref\" id=\"cite_ref-13\" href=\"#cite_note-13\">13<\/a>. Mexico City and Bogot\u00e1 have introduced number plate restrictions with measurable impacts on congestion and air quality<a class=\"cite_ref\" id=\"cite_ref-14\" href=\"#cite_note-14\">14<\/a>. Efficient, affordable and reliable public transport alternatives further reduce the appeal of the private car. In recent years, more established cities of the global North, like Copenhagen, Amsterdam, London and New York, have consistently invested in pro-cycling and walking strategies.<\/p>\n<p>Electricity and heat production contribute 37 per cent of global energy related carbon emissions<a class=\"cite_ref\" id=\"cite_ref-15\" href=\"#cite_note-15\">15<\/a>. Some cities have invested heavily in clean electricity and heat production such as photovoltaic (PV) systems located on building roofs and facades, or in dedicated open areas. In Freiburg, PV systems cover 13,000 square metres (139,931 square feet) of the city\u2019s building surfaces \u2013 including the main railway station \u2013 while San Francisco operates the largest city-owned solar power system in the United States<a class=\"cite_ref\" id=\"cite_ref-16\" href=\"#cite_note-16\">16<\/a>. Further opportunities are offered by wind energy, with turbines typically located outside city boundaries. The \u2018London Array\u2019 offshore wind-turbine system is projected to produce 1,000 MW, enough to power 750,000 homes<a class=\"cite_ref\" id=\"cite_ref-17\" href=\"#cite_note-17\">17<\/a>. These investments typically carry a higher up-front cost than conventional energy generation, but with the potential for significant energy cost savings in the longer term, greater energy security, and the ability to drive innovation in dynamic export technology sectors. <\/p>\n<p>Copenhagen\u2019s district heating system, which captures waste heat from electricity production, normally released into the sea as hot water, has helped reduce emissions and shaves \u20ac1,400 (US$1,907) off household bills per annum. It is estimated that people in metropolitan Portland, Oregon, save US$2 (\u20ac1.47) billion annually through coordinated changes in land use and transport policies over the last three decades. These include modest increases in building density, light rail transit schemes and policies to encourage walking and cycling. In many European cities, recycling levels are in the region of 50 per cent of domestic waste, while Copenhagen sends only 3 per cent of its waste to landfills<a class=\"cite_ref\" id=\"cite_ref-18\" href=\"#cite_note-18\">18<\/a>. Buildings contribute 25 per cent of the world\u2019s energy-related greenhouse gas emissions<a class=\"cite_ref\" id=\"cite_ref-19\" href=\"#cite_note-19\">19<\/a>. The imposition of tough building standards and mandatory energy certificates, as well as the provision of tax incentives and loans, has also had a measurable impact on energy demand in a number of European and American cities<a class=\"cite_ref\" id=\"cite_ref-20\" href=\"#cite_note-20\">20<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Integrated technologies will help make dense complex cities work efficiently and consume more collaboratively. Cities provide a critical mass of potential users for a wide range of IT-based services, which build upon complex physical infrastructure systems (such as roads, rail, cabling and distribution systems buildings). A broadband digital infrastructure can connect people to people, people to city systems and city systems to city systems, allowing cities and their residents to respond to changing circumstances in near real-time. Improved monitoring and measurement of resource flow patterns will allow more informed infrastructural investment decisions<a class=\"cite_ref\" id=\"cite_ref-21\" href=\"#cite_note-21\">21<\/a>. In addition, smart transport systems are being used to tackle congestion, facilitate road-user charges or supply real-time information on traffic problems \u2013 examples include Stockholm\u2019s congestion tax and Singapore\u2019s electronic road pricing. Amsterdam currently trials smart work centres that allow workers to use local office facilities rather than having to commute to their main office<a class=\"cite_ref\" id=\"cite_ref-22\" href=\"#cite_note-22\">22<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>From a policy perspective, therefore, this is not only about the construction of the infrastructure for roads, buses and railways; it is also about their pricing and management, regulations applying to the location of homes, the use of cars and the design of cities. It concerns the structure of workplaces and practices affecting conventions for physical attendance. Many, or most of these, involve networks in some shape or form in which the decisions of an individual on where to live, how to move, how to interact and how to commute have powerful effects on others.   <\/p>\n<p>Given the growing evidence of a virtuous circle associated with green cities and prosperity, the question arises why not more cities commit to green growth. Firstly, the payback from investment in energy efficiency is not immediate and usually requires an additional up-front investment. Liquidity constraints and limited access to capital may therefore preclude profitable investments. Secondly, the gains from energy efficiency and renewable investment may not have been recognised yet. As fossil fuel and other scarce resources continue to rise in price, and as the policy environment clamps down on waste, this should change. However, even where clear gains have existed in the past, there have been a number of barriers such as split incentives, managerial shortcomings, weak monitoring and a lack of capacity and expertise preventing optimal investment in resource efficiency.<\/p>\n<p>The global low-carbon energy market is expected to triple to US$ 2.2 trillion per annum by 2020<a class=\"cite_ref\" id=\"cite_ref-23\" href=\"#cite_note-23\">23<\/a> while global investment in renewable energy jumped 32 per cent in 2010, to $211 billion<a class=\"cite_ref\" id=\"cite_ref-24\" href=\"#cite_note-24\">24<\/a>. A broad range of successful cities will increasingly specialise in higher-end business services, which can include activities such as environmental consulting and intermediating carbon. Clearly, opportunities will vary from city to city in accordance with income levels, policy frameworks, industry compositions and available options for low-carbon transition. Further empirical investigation is required, and this demands the development of a consistent urban database and improved assessments of best practice. Yet this does not mean that cities should wait for perfect information before taking into account the latest understanding of climate change when making long-term planning decisions. How cities develop is part of the climate problem, but it can also be part of the response. <\/p>\n<p>Successful cities will effectively engage citizens in decision making, while enabling local actors in government, business and the community to build a harmonious and creative environment to live and work. Effecting policy action is often easier at the city level where policymakers are closer, physically and culturally, to their citizens than national governments. All cities have opportunities to guide urban planning and prevent the expansion and lock in of high-carbon infrastructure. Fast growing cities are today planning and committing to long-lived urban structures, which afford either unique opportunities or unforeseeable risks, while old established cities will need to think about how to replace and retrofit existing capital and infrastructure. <\/p>\n<p>Cities are complex heterogeneous entities that share some common properties. There is no \u2018one size fits all\u2019 solution, but all cities have scope to improve efficiency, make greater use of renewable resources and improve the environment for innovation, with significant economic as well as environmental returns. The investments and strategic decisions made over the next few years will determine where the winners and losers will be in rising to the challenge of a sustainable future.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"<p><a class=\"cite_note\" id=\"cite_note-1\" href=\"#cite_ref-1\">1<\/a> World Bank, Cities and Climate Change: An Urgent Agenda (Washington DC, 2010).<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"cite_note\" id=\"cite_note-2\" href=\"#cite_ref-2\">2<\/a> D.

Over half the world is now urban, and according to the 2006 State of the World Cities report, urban-based economic activities account for 55 per cent of the gross national product in the least developed countries, 73 per cent in middle income countries, and 85 per cent in the most developed countries. Cities are precious.<\/p>\n<p>Cities are also critical geographical units in the formulation and implementation of sectoral policies \u2013 in water, transport and communications, energy, waste management and construction \u2013 that will shape our future for better or worse. Over the next few decades, climate change related disasters will have a significant economic and human impact on cities, in developing as well as in the most developed countries. Cities are at risk.<\/p>\n<p>Cities are also where a range of environmental and developmental challenges find their crude expression \u2013 air and water pollution, greenhouse gas emissions from transport or energy consumption, social exclusion and slum developments, poverty and criminality. When we realise that cities emit three quarters of pollutant emissions worldwide, we should think that cities are the place where the \u2018big push\u2019 should be undertaken, to use Jeffrey Sachs\u2019 expression. Greening our cities can not just have immediate multi-dimensional economic benefits, but also long-term positive effects as it will reduce the impact of cities on climate change, and de facto the impact that climate change will have on cities.<\/p>\n<p>The cluster of human settlements is embedded in our postmodern culture, especially in developing countries, where a total of 145,000 new urban dwellers are introduced into the urban age every day. It is absolutely necessary to generate a global action plan for mayors to improve sustainability locally, and promote the sustainable green development of their cities. Local Agenda 21 enshrined in the 1992 Rio Convention led to a proactive engagement of mayors from around the world to drastically reduce their city emissions. While there is evidence that implementing Local Agenda 21 has proved challenging, even in some developed countries, there is a general recognition that it contributed to setting the stage for local authorities to take up the challenge of improving the environment in their cities.<\/p>\n<p>The time has now come to take a step further, and to think of the myriad challenges laid out in Local Agenda 21 in the context of an Urban Age seeking its way towards a Green Economy. Cities will be central in bringing about tomorrow\u2019s economic benefits and welfare, the provision of decent jobs and human well-being within an environment liberated from the risks and threats of climate change, pollution, resource depletion and ecosystem degradation.<\/p>\n<p>Part of the multi-billion stimulus packages being enacted around the world to face today\u2019s multi-dimensional crises are destined to boost green infrastructure, maximise energy use and materials efficiency, stimulate the use of renewable energy, and generate new kind of jobs, all of which will help create cleaner, greener and richer economies. Nonetheless, key questions remain: will the 16 per cent of green stimulus allocated in climate change investments be sufficient to restructure the global economy? Will all this work and what can \u2018greening\u2019 do for the world cities and the world economy, for employment and for poverty?<\/p>\n<p>Achieving the transformative change in cities requires that we urgently integrate urban design in our planning policies, co-integrate nature and human economic development harmoniously, building and designing with nature. In order to give birth to a green urban age, we need to reduce our consumption patterns, change our habits, and base our production dynamics on resource efficiency and recycling. Many of these indicative criteria depend on the way cities have been shaped. In US cities, David Satterthwaite has noted how people use six times more cars than in wealthy Asian cities, mostly because of the urban sprawl and the lack of connectivity to public transport. In International Energy Agency \u2018business as usual\u2019 scenarios, CO2 emissions from the transport sector are expected to grow by 120 per cent by 2050 compared to 2000 levels. The global car fleet will triple, and more than 90 per cent of this growth will take place in non-OECD countries. In order to curb greenhouse gas emissions from transport, we must reduce automobile dependence, foster a rapid modal shift towards less carbon intensive forms of transport such as rail, and improve fuel and motor efficiency.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_725\" style=\"width: 602px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-725\" title=\"03_01\" src=\"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/11\/03_01.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"592\" height=\"563\" \/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Green Stimulus Funds 2008\/2009<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Cities can catalyse a modal and efficiency shift by targeting investment for well-planned, greener transport infrastructure that meets the needs of all users \u2013 both motorised and non-motorised. The planning of urban centres and their peripheries according to mixed-use and smart growth design principles must be part of a sustainable transport future. Urban development along these principles will serve to lower dependence on personal vehicles and support the increased use of public transport systems and non-motorised transport for short distances and daily commutes. Together with integrated transport planning and demand management, low-carbon fuels and greater electrification of transport are needed to meet short- and long-term economic and sustainability targets. The efficiency of light-duty vehicles in OECD countries is already capable of being improved by 30 per cent over the next 15 to 20 years. A widespread adoption of this efficiency in non-OECD countries and greater hybridisation and electrification of fleets could deliver a 50 per cent improvement in vehicle efficiency.<\/p>\n<p>Policies promoting densification in the design of cities can reduce demand for long-distance transport. Planning and high density developments are totally compatible, as can be seen in the successful examples of planning green, dense cities that exist in some major wealthy Asian cities. In addition, land use regulations can ensure that habitations are located in places that provide greater efficiency in the use of energy and materials. For instance, many environmentalists want to limit development in Californian coastal cities, even if households there consume less energy due to geographical reasons than elsewhere in the US. Yet restricting construction in California could mean more houses in Houston, Texas, where households consume more energy for heating and people have to drive more because of the urban sprawl.<\/p>\n<p>Incentives and regulations in the building and construction sector offer opportunities for cities and local governments to leverage their authority in the setting of standards and the issuing of building permits. These measures, including mandatory investments in energyefficiency or the installation of renewable energy technologies in buildings, can make a substantial impact. Many countries are already heading in this direction. Germany, for instance, launched a programme retrofitting existing housing stocks to improve energy efficiency. So far, retrofitting over 200,000 apartments has created 25,000 new jobs and sustained 116,000 existing jobs. A worldwide transition to energy efficient buildings would create millions of jobs as well as the \u2018greening\u2019 of existing jobs for the estimated 111 million people already employed in the sector. Investments in improved energy efficiency in buildings could generate an additional 2 to 3.5 million green jobs in Europe and the United States alone. The potential is much higher in developing countries and in countries in transition. The latter often have large stocks of inefficient buildings. Investments in green buildings have already been proposed for inclusion in a number of economic stimulus packages, including France, Germany, Japan, the Republic of Korea and the United Kingdom. Technologies and materials to improve the efficiency of buildings are commercially available at competitive prices. Using current building technology, we can already cut energy use by around 80 per cent compared to conventional designs. In order to achieve a wide adoption of these technologies and materials in new construction and renovation, however, there is a need for large-scale investments in skill development and capacity building. This is essential for increasing the supply of, and access to such technologies and materials, particularly in developing countries.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_726\" style=\"width: 784px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-726\" title=\"03_02\" src=\"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/11\/03_02.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"774\" height=\"210\" \/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Breakdown of Green Stymulus Fund<\/p><\/div>\n<p>A Green Urban Age will have to recognise and confront the social and developmental challenges facing cities today head on.

One in three urban dwellers \u2013 828 million people \u2013 lives in a slum, producing slum cities within cities. More than 90 per cent of slums are found in developing countries. Slum dwellers are not the only poor residents of cities, but they do represent a clustering of living conditions within a city. As urbanisation continues, even if the relative levels of urban poor remain constant, the absolute number of people living in poverty in cities will rise. Poverty is set to become an increasingly urban phenomenon.<br \/> Urban poor populations, and the places where they live, are diverse. Neighbourhoods are not uniformly poor, and being poor does not necessarily mean suffering ill-health. Health is determined by many diverse factors, including income, gender, age, access to health services and infrastructure. Yet we know little about the health of the urban poor.<\/p>\n<h3>How can we get data on the health of the urban poor?<\/h3>\n<p>Rapid urban growth places increased demands on already overstretched agencies to collect data from and about the urban poor. Even aggregate &#8216;headcount&#8217; data can fail to keep up with rapidly changing urban populations. We know that slum residents tend to be less likely to be included in censuses and surveys (they might want to remain hidden if their residence is illegal), that slums are difficult places for interviewers to work in, and that slum households tend to be less likely to be included in routine mapping of neighbourhoods. Many urban poor are hard to reach from the perspectives of the people that run censuses and surveys.<\/p>\n<p>The data that do exist tend to be aggregated at a level which ignores and masks differentials within cities and between neighbourhoods. We need disaggregated data if we are to really understand, and improve, the health of the urban poor. Not only do we need more distinction within cities, we need more distinction between cities. Continuing to compare \u2018rural\u2019 and \u2018urban\u2019 populations within countries (the dominant approach of demography and health surveys) doesn\u2019t make sense when we know that the boundaries between urban and rural are fuzzy and continually evolving in planned and unplanned ways. It also masks differences between cities of different sizes and wealth. We know very little about the health of poor people in the world\u2019s 500 smaller cities (between one million and ten million inhabitants), because research has tended to focus on megacities with more than ten million inhabitants.<\/p>\n<h3>Urban advantage or urban penalty?<\/h3>\n<p>How we measure urban health affects whether we find an urban advantage, disadvantage or even a \u2018double-burden\u2019 in health. An urban advantage in health tends to be found when analyses just focus on crude urban vs. rural comparisons, ignoring whether people are poor or not. When we compare the chances of survival of young children between urban and rural areas, the chances of dying by their first birthday tend to be higher in rural areas.<br \/> But these sorts of comparisons ignore the heterogeneity of urban areas and populations. Averages at the rural and urban level can disguise significant variations, not just in terms of health outcomes, but also in terms of health systems and services and living conditions. In our opinion, such crude urban-rural comparisons mask the real health implications of being urban and poor in many low-income countries. Instead, we need to better understand the poor\u2013rich gaps in health within urban areas. Where the evidence exists, it suggests that many urban poor, in particular children before they reach their fifth birthday, are in fact paying an urban penalty with their health.<\/p>\n<p>This urban penalty might be related to a double burden of disease facing the urban poor. There is rising prevalence of both infectious and chronic diseases in slum communities, interacting in ways that increase the chances of ill-health and premature death. It is not the case, then, that chronic diseases affect only the rich: the urban poor are also affected by these \u2018diseases of affluence\u2019. Overcrowding and poor sanitation can increase the risk of respiratory, viral and skin diseases. Lifestyle and everyday responses to difficult social environments can increase population risk of the major chronic diseases. People might not have access to nutritious food, increasing the risk of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and major cancers. Where early sexual activity occurs, perhaps due to peer pressure or as a survival strategy, and there is an increased risk of sexually transmitted infections, the risk of developing an HIV-related cancer can also increase. In conditions of extreme poverty, adults and young people may be more likely to drink alcohol, smoke and use drugs\u00a0to ease everyday psycho-social stresses. Yet each is a major risk factor for cancers, cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Livelihood strategies can increase infectious and chronic health risks. For example, young people who make a living from \u2018e-waste\u2019 (electronic devices dumped as waste, often in poor urban neighbourhoods) are exposed to toxic materials that can cause serious conditions such as cancer of the lymph system, central nervous system damage and asthma.<\/p>\n<h3>Why is access to health services so bad for the urban poor?<\/h3>\n<p>Urban populations are often assumed to have better access to health care than those living in rural areas. However, urban health systems in many poorer countries have a weak to non-existent public health structure and lack implementation and infrastructures. Rapid urban growth in many settings has exceeded the capacity of health systems to serve rapidly growing urban populations. Just because health services are located in an urban area does not mean that they are easily accessible by the urban poor. Health workers find it difficult or are reluctant to serve extremely poor urban areas. A female slum resident who is pregnant might live a short distance from emergency obstetric services, but if she needs help in the middle of the night, it might be too dangerous for her to leave her home to seek help.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, the cost of health care represents a significant barrier for the urban poor. Poor populations spend a significant part of their income on health care: it is estimated that more than 100 million people are pushed into poverty every year due to health care expenses. As the presence of multiple ill-health conditions increase in urban settings, health care costs can push poor people further into poverty.<\/p>\n<h3>What do we need to know?<\/h3>\n<p>We need to know what works to improve the health of the urban poor. The existing evidence base is tiny compared to the rapidly growing and large urban poor population, with almost no qualitative evidence to complement the limited quantitative data. We need high-quality evidence on effective and sustainable interventions that specifically target the urban poor. The starting point must be disaggregated data which makes visible the significant differences between areas and populations within cities.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/11\/2011_chw_4060_Coast-deGraftAikins.pdf","article_publishing_date":"November 2011","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"118","name":"Ernestina","created":"2011-11-04 11:29:50","modified":"2013-02-07 18:00:21","slug":"coast-ernestina","family_name":"Coast","title":"","email_address":"","photo_legacy":"","profile_text":"<p>Ernestina Coast is\u00a0senior lecturer in Population Studies at\u00a0LSE Health.<\/p>","organization":"","role":"","additional_affiliations":"","qualifications":"","staff_pages_blurb":"","office_location":"","display_after":"","display_until":"","extended_blurb":"","special_2012ec_blurb":"","special_2012ec_affiliation":"","special_2013rio_blurb":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb_lang2":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation_lang2":null,"phone_number":null}],"attachments":false,"gallery":{"slug":false,"extra_classes":"","slides":[]}},{"request_language":"","current_page_uri":"\/media\/search-dev.json","lang2_slug":false,"lang2_name":false,"parent_publication_id":19,"featured_image_uri":"","article_title":"Health in Hong Kong: An International Urban Perspective","permalink":"health-in-hong-kong-an-international-urban-perspective","article_subtitle":"","article_abstract":"","article_summary":"","article_text":"<h3>Cities, population health and health care systems<\/h3>\n<p>Hong Kong stands out among wealthy megacities as having some of the best indicators of population health. Infant mortality is 3.0 per 1,000 births in Hong Kong compared to 6.2 in New York City and 4.0 in Paris, while life expectancy at birth is 78.0 years compared to 77.7 years in Tokyo and 76.1 years in Greater London (Table 1). Such indicators are too broad, however, to draw useful inferences about the performance of Hong Kong\u2019s health care system, let alone the effects of Hong Kong, as a city, on its population\u2019s health. It is difficult to disentangle the relative importance of health systems and diverse city characteristics, such as population density, levels of environmental pollution or the nature of the built environment, from the multiple determinants of health, including the sociocultural factors and the neighbourhood context of the population whose health is measured.<\/p>\n<p>Health is a bit like the sky. It covers everything \u2013 longevity, freedom from disease, quality of life, well-being \u2013 yet it touches nothing and is therefore hard to grasp. Different measures of population health are influenced by genetic and environmental factors and by what the World Health Organization (WHO) calls \u2018the social determinants of health\u2019, which range from income, educational levels, housing conditions and nutrition to social relationships, health promotion and health care services like disease prevention (vaccinations and screening). Campaigns like the WHO\u2019s Healthy Cities highlight the importance of intersectoral strategies to health promotion. Not surprisingly, such strategies involve long lists of recommended interventions without much guidance as to the relative importance of each one.<\/p>\n<p>Because of these complexities, the field of urban health is dominated by studies of sub-populations within cities \u2013 migrants, ethnic minorities, IV drug-injecting populations and those suffering from HIV\/AIDS or drug-resistant tuberculosis. There has been less attention to comparing health care systems among cities, and evaluating the extent to which such systems and city characteristics affect various measures of population health. An alternative approach is to describe a range of health systems among cities that share a host of key characteristics to assess their performance and to speculate about the challenges they share and the extent to which, to quote Paul Val\u00e9ry, they may \u2018enrich themselves with their mutual differences\u2019.<\/p>\n<p>Here I focus on Hong Kong\u2019s health system and the public health challenges faced by all megacities, as well as those specific to Hong Kong. In addition, I highlight some lessons from the experience of how three cities \u2013 New York, Greater London and Paris \u2013 have developed convergent strategies to protect their population\u2019s health and provide their residents with access to health care services. I conclude with some questions for urban planners concerned with cities and health.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_1914\" style=\"width: 1290px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"\/files\/2012\/05\/chw-rodwin-table1.gif\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1914\" title=\"Table 1.

There are, however, two other indicators which stand out as valid measures of a health system\u2019s performance with respect to assuring access to medical care known to have an impact on health: avoidable mortality (AM) and access to primary care. AM measures deaths before the age of 75 due to diseases for which there are effective health care interventions: disease prevention services, primary care and specialty services. Access to primary care is often evaluated by measuring the magnitude of hospitalisations for so-called \u2018avoidable hospital conditions\u2019 (AHC). The assumption is that if patients receive appropriate and timely health care before their conditions flare up, they can avoid painful and expensive inpatient hospital care. On the basis of these indicators, research I have conducted with Chau, Woo, Chan, Welsz and Gusmano suggests that Hong Kong\u2019s health care system is not as good as most people suppose based on indicators of its strong population health status.<\/p>\n<p>Judged on the basis of AM, Hong Kong has the second lowest rate in comparison to Manhattan, Paris and Inner London. Although this is impressive, it is misleading when interpreted in light of its residents\u2019 relatively good health status (Table 1). As a proportion of all deaths, however, Hong Kong has the highest proportion of AM. This suggests that health system improvements could save lives. We found that Hong Kong also has the second lowest rate of hospital admissions for AHC, at least with respect to people aged 65 and over. Once again, when interpreted in light of the population\u2019s relatively good health status, this suggests that measures can still be taken to improve Hong Kong\u2019s health system, particularly with respect to the many residents who delay visits for primary care and are admitted to overcrowded hospitals after exacerbations of conditions that should have been managed by primary care physicians.<\/p>\n<p>These findings may come as a surprise for those who would immediately jump to the conclusion that high levels of population health reflect an excellent health care system and a healthy city. However, they are not surprising given that Hong Kong\u2019s health care system provides free service in public hospitals yet relies on practitioners in private fee-for-service practice for the provision of primary care. Since only around 30 per cent of the population have employer-based insurance, most of the population has to pay out-of-pocket for primary care by physicians in private practices or rely entirely on the public hospital system and its affiliated outpatient clinics where physician-patient encounters are notoriously brief and available primary care is considered inadequate to meet the population\u2019s needs.<\/p>\n<h3>Public health challenges<\/h3>\n<p>Beyond such health system problems, like other world cities, Hong Kong faces similar convergent public health challenges. First, the return of infectious diseases and the emergence of new ones, such as AIDS, SARS and the avian flu virus (H5N1). Second, the risk of terrorism, including bioterrorism, and emergencies stemming from climate change, such as heat waves or flooding. Third, the challenge of overcoming barriers in access to health services for recent migrants, the poor and\/or ethnic minorities. Fourth, megacities worldwide face rising inequalities among social groups and city neighbourhoods, which are reflected in the simultaneous growth of homelessness, poverty and wealth. Finally, cities must face the health consequences of environmental pollution, which are exacerbated in Hong Kong by its topography, roadside emissions of respirable particulates, and proximity to mainland China\u2019s Pearl River Delta (PRD) region.<\/p>\n<p>Hong Kong faces a unique long-term challenge due to PRD\u2019s rapid growh. With its population of more than 47 million, PRD\u2019s GDP grew at an annual rate of 21.2 per cent between 1978 and 2007, more than twice the national average. For the period 2008 to 2020, the State Council\u2019s plan for PRD focuses on massive physical infrastructure projects to improve integration among its nine cities, thereby creating the largest megacity-region in the world. This likely comes at the expense of public health initiatives and health care resources, contributing to the PRD\u2019s staggering public health problems and severe barriers in access to health care including:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Unprecedented levels of environmental pollution, which are known to increase hospital admissions for asthma and cardio-respiratory disease as well as mortality from these conditions;<\/li>\n<li>A massive influx (20 million) of migrants, many with associated social problems;<\/li>\n<li>Industrial accidents resulting from dangerous working conditions;<\/li>\n<li>A high incidence of infectious diseases (including AIDS, drug-resistant tuberculosis and malaria), rising chronic disease, a high prevalence of mental problems and maternal and children\u2019s health issues; and<\/li>\n<li>Flagrant inequalities in income which have exacerbated barriers of access to health care. Although access is supposed to change as the new national health insurance legislation is implemented, it looms as an enormous challenge for local experts who have already attributed the labour shortages of 2004 and 2007 to inadequate social insurance cover.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Hong Kong smog levels are already affected by the environmental pollution from PRD. In developing strategies to maintain population health, planners will have to confront the challenges posed by PRD\u2019s rapid growth. In some respects, they may draw useful lessons from the successes and failures of other world cities in wealthy nations.<\/p>\n<h3>Lessons from other megacities<\/h3>\n<p>Experience from other megacities in wealthy nations, notably New York, London, Paris and Tokyo, is important because they have survived devastating disease epidemics in the past and have established a strong public health infrastructure. All four cities are characterised by significant disparities in income, educational attainment, unemployment rates, housing and environmental conditions among their neighbourhoods. These social determinants of health must be addressed in order to improve population health. In addition, they have important implications for how to target health protection and promotion programmes, and for how to improve emergency preparedness and communication with diverse urban populations. In New York, London and Paris public health leaders have targeted programmes for their poorest residents and for immigrant populations from around the world.<\/p>\n<p>New York stands out, though, because it has the largest share of its population not covered under a national system that eliminates financial barriers to health care access. And yet it has one of the most sophisticated disease surveillance systems. Still, there is one convergent trend in public health from which Hong Kong could learn with respect to the experience of New York, Paris and London. Among those cities with the greatest social inequalities, public health leaders have recognised that the city neighbourhood is a critical spatial unit for interventions targeted to those populations at highest risk of disease. New York\u2019s Department of Health and Mental Hygiene has located three satellite offices in the highest-risk areas of the city \u2013 Central Harlem, East Brooklyn and the South Bronx. In Paris, the centrally managed <em>politique de ville<\/em> (policy for cities) has programmed infrastructure investments in those neighbourhoods with the highest rate of unemployment. In London, much attention has been placed, at least at the rhetorical level, on strategies to promote neighbourhood regeneration. Since cities are characterised by spatial inequalities in population and neighbourhood characteristics, this approach is not surprising. What is more, it highlights the potential of cities in the protection and promotion of population health.<\/p>\n<h3>Cities and health<\/h3>\n<p>There is widespread belief that the health of urban populations is not as good as that of the population as a whole. This \u2018urban health penalty\u2019 hypothesis is supported by a substantial body of work that documents higher rates of infectious diseases in cities than in their respective nations. Some studies have also found similar patterns for non-communicable diseases like heart disease and cancer.<\/p>\n<p>Those who challenge the urban penalty hypothesis point to contradictory evidence. They typically celebrate the city\u2019s vitality and capacity for innovation. For example, Metropolitan New York\u2019s economic output is greater than that of 45 of the 50 US states. Likewise, PRD accounts for 10 per cent of China\u2019s GDP despite containing only 3.6 per cent of its population. There is also a growing body of evidence in support of the hypothesis that urban health compares favourably to that of the nation as a whole. For example, life expectancy at birth is higher in New York, Paris and Hong Kong than the national average. In addition, among older people in the world cities we have studied, there appears to be an urban advantage in terms of longevity.<\/p>\n<p>With respect to population health, the challenge for megacities is whether they can evolve from breeding grounds for the rapid transmission of disease to critical spatial entities for the protection and promotion of population health. We know that certain forms of suburban development that require car ownership and attract commuter populations also serve to limit exercise, facilitate obesity and even allow for a higher incidence of road rage. We know that populations in poor urban communities are disproportionately exposed to environmental toxins and that high population density can be a dangerous incubator for the spread of infectious disease. We also know that effective disease surveillance and access to health and social services can reduce the incidence and progression of disease leading to painful and expensive hospitalisations. But is this enough knowledge to address neighbourhood inequalities in health? How can it help us to design interventions in neighbourhoods with those populations that are at the highest risk?<\/p>\n<p>In our book, <em>Health Care in World Cities: New York, Paris, London<\/em>, Gusmano, Weisz and I argue that we should not overestimate the capacity of welfare states to serve those urban populations that fall through the cracks of national health and social entitlement programmes. Nor should we underestimate the ability of city governments to address social issues, including the health of their residents. Such efforts include New York\u2019s expansion of farmers\u2019 markets in poorer neighbourhoods, London\u2019s promotion of neighbourhood regeneration and Paris\u2019 systematic attention to locating local social service offices and maternal and child programmes in areas of higher risk. The extent to which such interventions succeed in meeting population health objectives is difficult to evaluate for a host of methodological and political reasons. Much anecdotal evidence suggests that the proliferation of neighbourhood-level interventions matters. More importantly, the convergence of efforts across cities to target neighbourhoods with populations considered at highest risk for social exclusion and disease the time is ripe for city planners and public health experts to collaborate in the design and evaluation of neighbourhood-level interventions to protect and promote population health.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/11\/2011_chw_3060_Rodwin.pdf","article_publishing_date":"November 2011","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"111","name":"Victor G.","created":"2011-11-04 10:02:45","modified":"2011-11-04 10:02:45","slug":null,"family_name":"Rodwin","title":null,"email_address":null,"photo_legacy":null,"profile_text":null,"organization":null,"role":null,"additional_affiliations":null,"qualifications":null,"staff_pages_blurb":null,"office_location":null,"display_after":null,"display_until":null,"extended_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb_lang2":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation_lang2":null,"phone_number":null}],"attachments":false,"gallery":{"slug":false,"extra_classes":"","slides":[]}},{"request_language":"","current_page_uri":"\/media\/search-dev.json","lang2_slug":false,"lang2_name":false,"parent_publication_id":19,"featured_image_uri":"","article_title":"Healthy People in Modern Cities","permalink":"healthy-people-in-modern-cities","article_subtitle":null,"article_abstract":"","article_summary":"","article_text":"<p>Science and technology have always been and will continue to be the driving forces of developments in societies, especially those that address the questions of where and how we live.

We can now start to answer questions about how life emerged 3.5 billion years ago and where we, homo sapiens, come from. We can begin to understand our genomic history, and know more about the appearance of modern man in Africa and how he colonised the world over the last 100,000 years. It is evident from this research that our genes and important functions have been conserved throughout billions of years of evolution. We know that the human body is a living archive of the origins of life. The more important specific genes are for biological functions, the better and longer they have been conserved in evolution.<br \/> Modern genome research and the new concept of evolutionary medicine open up completely new avenues to a better understanding of the basis of health and disease. In addition to asking proximate questions about how biological mechanisms of a disease are best understood, diagnosed and treated, we can also now investigate the ultimate question, namely: why do we get sick?<\/p>\n<p>With our evolutionary &#8216;old&#8217; biology we are living in a completely new and fast-changing (mostly artificial) human-made environment: the city. No longer are we labouring hard to harvest a scarce living like in the stone age. No longer are we running away from big animals to avoid being killed, or chasing smaller animals in order to provide food for our families. Much of modern urbanised society is now dependent on industrially manufactured food, ordered by smart phone from the department store and delivered straight to our door. We eat too much, and consume foods that are too salty, sweet and full of fat. Some of us lead sedentary lives, and make a living by sitting in front of a computer all day and moving knowledge electronically to far distances around the world. Energy is provided from the plug and no longer burnt by exercising one&#8217;s musculoskeletal system.<\/p>\n<h3>Diseases of civilisation<\/h3>\n<p>We are thus facing a new challenge. In urbanised life, and in industrialised countries, new common diseases are emerging: obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, musculoskeletal diseases, osteoporosis, mental health problems, depression and so on. The underlying cause of these &#8216;diseases of civilisation&#8217; is that our modern lifestyles, which are manifest in our cities, are not in tune with our biological heritage.<\/p>\n<p>For the well-off in our globalised world, constantly sitting around became an attribute of an existence where physical work was no longer necessary, a result of the technical progress and affordable motorised mobility for a broad sector of the population, a development which first emerged in the twentieth century. This century was one characterised by reduced physical work and physical mobility \u2013 facilitated by high-tech cars and public transportation for the masses, as well as by more mundane innovations such as electric corkscrews and battery-powered pepper mills, for example. This is historically comprehensible since, until recently, relatively hard physical work was the standard, and the aspiration to afford some comfort in daily life was obvious and wide-spread.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile it has become clear that such comfort, which some can afford due to technical progress and unequal economic growth, can have negative consequences for our health. Hundreds of millions of humans no longer challenge their bodies physically and this, in turn, leads to functional impairment. Thinner, weaker muscles, whose abilities to burn carbohydrates and fat is lessened, as well as fragile bones, increased resistance to insulin and an increase in heart disease, are threatening those who lead an idle existence. From an evolutionary perspective the bodies of physically inactive humans are in a highly exceptional state. But, because of our urbanised lifestyles and physical inactivity, it is not our external stature that will be affected so much as our inner well-being and health, and these stresses will frequently go unnoticed.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore the discrepancy between our biological heritage and modern lifestyles makes us ill. The gap between evolutionary &#8216;old&#8217; body functions, on the one hand, and modern lifestyles in new urban societies, on the other, results in the above mentioned &#8216;diseases of civilisation&#8217;. They are the biggest burden on health care systems within modern knowledge-based societies. Evolutionary medicine makes use of these new insights for the research, diagnosis, treatment and, most importantly, prevention of diseases.<\/p>\n<p>A large part of our modern civilisation depends on the close collaboration and exchange of ideas between peoples, a necessity enhanced by our fast-urbanising globe. Moving back to the countryside, as some romantic ecologists propose, is not a realistic solution for solving today\u2019s health problems. The great achievement that makes humans unique and which explains our special path in the animal kingdom beyond biological evolution is not only our coexistence in dynamic societies but also, and primarily, our creative cooperation based on a division of labour.<\/p>\n<h3>New infectious diseases<\/h3>\n<p>The city is a stimulus and source of continuous progress and development of new technologies. The city is the place where humans can realise cooperative and collaborative lifestyles. But history also shows us that the development of new settlements and cities was followed closely by the rise of new diseases. At the end of the last ice age, around 10,000 years ago, the world flourished. Humans changed from being hunter-gatherers to building and settling down in villages and towns and developing farming and cattle-breeding technologies. They exploited new food sources, they domesticated the first plants and animals, and the number of the people on the planet increased. By actively planning their environment at an ever-increasing rate not only did human behaviour change but also, without us being aware of it, the behaviour and opportunities of micro-organisms. This is the moment when infectious diseases were born in evolution.<\/p>\n<p>All kinds of animals, from mosquitos to rats, were attracted by the fields, grain stocks, waste and faeces that were mounting in permanently growing settlements, villages and cities. Infectious microbes and their carriers, bigger animals, including mice, rats and humans, found their paradise: protection from predators in the city and a wide range of &#8216;food&#8217;. Along with them came many pathogens, which discovered humans as a new host. As this host reproduced more rapidly, their future was secured. Before major human settlements and urbanisation, there were simply too few people living together to keep an infectious agent alive. People lived in quite small units and continually moved from one place to another. If there was a pathogen that developed and survived by transfer from human to human, the whole group would eventually be wiped out and the pathogen itself reached, literally, a dead end. Or natural selection ensured that only a few very resistant individuals survived, and that this resistance was passed down to their offspring and gave the microbe no further chance to reproduce.<\/p>\n<p>The success of deadly epidemics caused by viruses or bacteria that decimated the population periodically in history was only possible under the condition of settlements and the development of larger stable communities. With the development of urban civilisation, infectious and virulent microbes no longer meet dead ends, but move from host to host, surviving and multiplying happily. In cities, even the most deadly viruses and microbes can survive, since in these large, densely packed populations, there is always a new host to infect. With humans now travelling as much as they do, the whole world population is a potential host for infectious agents, and thereby the pool of pathogen carriers is ever-increasing.<\/p>\n<p>Modern medicine has developed strategies to counteract these new and unique threats brought about by urbanisation: standards of hygienic and other implementations, for example, which aim to control major infectious diseases. Aside from vaccines and antibiotics, modern water and wastewater management systems are crucial for survival in the city and for the fending off of diseases. These same systems, however, lead to extreme vulnerability in humans if they become contaminated by disease. Major epidemics, such as SARS, EHEC and Bird flu, and the attention paid to them internationally, attest to the reality of the threats and the possible social and economic costs to humans. If concepts for healthier cities are going to hold ground, they need to take account of these new insights from evolutionary medicine.<\/p>\n<h3>Disease prevention is the name of the game<\/h3>\n<p>In many instances we know why we get sick and how to avoid becoming sick. It is more effective and cheaper to prevent a disease than to treat it, which is why architects, city planners, politicians and medical practitioners will have to collaborate more effectively if they want to learn from each other and build better and healthier cities. Cities are places of collaboration and cooperation. We have to make better use of them if we want to improve our future.<\/p>\n<p>The help of Thilo Spahl, Berlin, in preparing and reviewing the manuscript is gratefully acknowledged.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"<p>The help of Thilo Spahl, Berlin, in preparing and reviewing the manuscript is gratefully acknowledged.<\/p>\n","pdf_uri":"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/11\/2011_chw_4040_Ganten.pdf","article_publishing_date":"November 2011","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"116","name":"Detlev","created":"2011-11-04 11:26:59","modified":"2011-11-04 11:26:59","slug":null,"family_name":"Ganten","title":null,"email_address":null,"photo_legacy":null,"profile_text":null,"organization":null,"role":null,"additional_affiliations":null,"qualifications":null,"staff_pages_blurb":null,"office_location":null,"display_after":null,"display_until":null,"extended_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb_lang2":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation_lang2":null,"phone_number":null}],"attachments":false,"gallery":{"slug":false,"extra_classes":"","slides":[]}},{"request_language":"","current_page_uri":"\/media\/search-dev.json","lang2_slug":false,"lang2_name":false,"parent_publication_id":19,"featured_image_uri":"","article_title":"High Density from the Ground","permalink":"high-density-from-the-ground","article_subtitle":null,"article_abstract":"<p>Following the city-wide analysis on Hong Kong, we now move to a fine-grained analysis of Hong Kong\u2019s complex urban fabric.

This is \u2018The Whampoa\u2019, a fibreglass shopping mall with seafood restaurants, a Jusco department store and one of seven themed shopping experiences that form \u2018The Wonderful Worlds of Whampoa\u2019. Most of the shopping worlds, however, are simply broad-brush themes for ground floor podium and underground levels that form the bases for residential towers. There are total of 12 development areas containing 88 tower blocks, 10,431 units and a total population of around 50,000 people. The residents are mainly middle-income families with the flat sale price being approximately US$1,028 (HK$8,000) per square foot in 2011. A three-bedroom, 93-square-metre (1,000-square-foot) flat would therefore cost around US$1.13 million (HK$8.8 million) to buy or US$3,200 (HK$25,000) a month to rent. However, this population also has access to 426,720 square metres (4.6 million square feet) of commercial activity, forming a staggering 85 square metres (915 square feet) per person, which is approximately the same size as a small residential unit.<\/p>\n<p>The estate was developed by the private developer, Hutchison Whampoa, which is part of business tycoon, Li-Ka Shing\u2019s, Cheung Kong Group. Hutchison Whampoa is the result of a series of business amalgamations and acquisitions that originated from the operator of the Hong Kong and Whampoa Dock in 1863. These docks, located on the South East coast of Kowloon were closed in 1985 with the new estate being completed in 1991. Unlike other dockland developments around the world there is no trace of the area\u2019s previous industrial heritage. This was erased and the docks were filled in. The new estate is like a condensed version of Le Corbusier\u2019s <em>Ville Contemporaine<\/em> (1922), a developer\u2019s utopia of a happy, mixed-use populace complete with 188,975 square metres (188,975 square feet) of open space, 300 shops, kindergartens, elderly centres, recreation facilities and a sea promenade.<\/p>\n<p>The Podium levels are accessed by stairs connected to the street or via the external courtyards of the shopping centres, and are linked together with bridge walkways. They contain seating, gardens, playgrounds and badminton, tennis and basketball courts and provide access to the residential towers. Densely packed, the towers\u2019 snowflake-plan provides an increased surface area for light and ventilation through four deep vertical light-wells. The majority of residents here commute to work. Although not directly connected to the Mass Transit Railway (MTR), the area is served by buses, mini-buses and taxis, with a free shuttle bus operated by the shopping centre that connects nearby districts. The area is close to Hung Hom station with trains to the New Territories and to mainland China and a ferry runs to North Point on Hong Kong Island.<\/p>\n<p>The area feels spacious and relaxed despite the density of population. However the mono-culture of shopping operated by a single corporation sets limits on the types of commercial and leisure activities that fit within their controlling remit. The attempts at \u2018themes\u2019 to provide further identity and diversity ultimately are meaningless \u2013 they are the same types of spaces and often sell similar products. Nevertheless this is Hong Kong and this development fits very well with the desires of the middle class: clean and controlled; with air-conditioned malls and open recreation spaces in equal abundance and linked effortlessly to lots and lots of shopping.<\/p>\n<h4>Sham Shui Po<\/h4>\n<p><a href=\"\/files\/2011\/11\/chw_sham-shui-po.gif\" rel=\"lightbox\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-935\" title=\"Sham Shui Po\" src=\"\/files\/2011\/11\/chw_sham-shui-po.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"960\" height=\"446\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>There are two main reasons to go to Sham Shui Po: to buy fabric or electrical components. Lace, thread, clasps, zips, buttons, and any other accoutrements of clothing manufacturing, can be purchased and lights, fuses, wiring, speakers, monitors and other technical gadgets can be bought in the market thoroughfare of Ap Liu Street. The textile trade originates from the area\u2019s historical development in the 1950s as a sub-production area for the garment industry, containing smaller factories for finishing or producing small machined parts. Like many of Hong Kong\u2019s industries these have now shifted to China, however, the commercial aspects have remained. Located close to Boundary Street, the demarcation between the British Colony and the mainland from 1860\u201398, Sham Shui Po was renowned for border trade and smuggling, and has been a popular settling place for new migrants since the 1950s.<\/p>\n<p>Today the area is well connected by the MTR and a plethora of bus routes and smaller minibus companies that link to Kowloon, the New Territories and Hong Kong Island. Exiting from the MTR you are subsumed by a barrage of signs, street vendors, shops and food stalls, extending in layers of activities from shops at street level. This commercial organisation has evolved from the traditional Tong Lau or Shop House, which had an arcade at ground level, creating a covered pedestrian walkway along the street.<\/p>\n<p>Each urban block was split into two, allowing a service alley to run between the blocks for ventilation and light. The 1950s brought a new building ordinance that raised the allowable building height in response to the need to create more housing for new migrants. The original Tong Lau were replaced, but certain features remained: the covered colonnade took the form of a cantilever, maintaining the set back and protected public area, and the basic footprint of the urban grid was unchanged. At street level the shops are interspersed with staircases that connect to the residences above. The number of inhabitants per flat varies drastically from a single family paying US$260\u2013510 (HK$2,000\u20134000) per month to the flat being divided into six rooms of 4.5\u20136 square metres (48\u201364\u00bd square feet) per room at US$193 (HK$1,500) per month, which are typically occupied by elderly couples or poor migrant families. Unimaginably the rooms are sometimes further subdivided into units of just 2 square metres (21\u00bd square feet) made up of simply a door opening to a bed frame. Even these can be vertically broken into two stacked units, known as \u2018cage homes\u2019, which offer beds for US$115 (HK$900) per month and can lead to densities of 40 people per flat. Advertised illegally through signs plastered at the staircase entrance these rooms can also be rented per hour and sometimes used as one-room brothels or \u2018love hotels\u2019.<\/p>\n<p>The residents of Sham Shui Po are relatively poor and elderly, with 28.9 per cent falling below the poverty line and 20.2 per cent over the age of 60. Public space is squeezed in where possible: a few benches outside of the MTR station; small pocket parks in the rare gaps between buildings or, bizarrely, a strip-park running between the traffic lanes of Nam Cheong Street, which is approximately 2.5 metres (8 feet) wide by 700 metres (2,296 feet) in length and fairly devoid of activity. This was formerly a drainage channel, or nullah, probably created to manage the water flow following the dramatic destruction of three hills and consequential land reclamation from 1912\u201329 in order to create the territory of the district itself.<\/p>\n<p>Like many of Hong Kong\u2019s older districts, Sham Shui Po\u2019s urban fabric is being gradually replaced through real-estate pressure and by the government\u2019s Urban Renewal Authority, which is replacing blocks designated unfit for living. Displaced residents relocate to other areas through compensation schemes, or take up places in public housing estates. Of course this is a desire for many residents given their inadequate living conditions, yet the strong ties of the social network of the neighbourhood may erode.<\/p>\n<h4>Sai Ying Pun<\/h4>\n<p><a href=\"\/files\/2011\/11\/chw_sai-ying-pun.gif\" rel=\"lightbox\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-936\" title=\"Sai Ying Pun\" src=\"\/files\/2011\/11\/chw_sai-ying-pun.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"960\" height=\"446\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Sai Ying Pun is one of Hong Kong\u2019s original settlement areas. As early as 1841, the British military decided it should be one of two strategic locations for a military base, with the other being close to the Albany Nullah and what is now present-day Central. A rough road, laid out by army engineers, connected the two sites and later became the main coastal thoroughfare of Queen\u2019s Road. The barracks at Sai Ying Pun soon attracted further settlers through the construction of a large warehouse or \u2018Godown\u2019 by Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., initiating the development of an informal Chinese settlement of shopkeepers and labourers. Within the same year, A. R. Johnston, Hong Kong\u2019s Deputy Superintendent at the time, began land subdivision, setting up plots for sale that ranged in scale from marine lots with waterfront access, to denser town lots, and more spacious suburban lots. In Sai Ying Pun an orthogonal grid was established with three main vertical streets, aptly named Eastern Street, Centre Street and Western Street, running north\u2013south from the water up to the hill and crossed by Queen\u2019s Road, First, Second and Third Street and at the top edge of the square, High Street. Owing to the extreme topography, land subdivision was organised around a terraced and stepped grid, which soon became full of three- and four-storey tenement buildings, interspersed with a fine network of back alleys and lanes. This organisational form of the settlement in the latter part of the nineteenth century has formed the origin point for all further transformation.<\/p>\n<p>This was challenged in the post-war period due to the double pressures of bomb-damaged buildings and a massive increase in population. Temporary settlements and illegal roof structures were constructed to meet the demand and it wasn\u2019t until the 1960s and \u201870s that the smaller tenements were replaced with five- and six-storey flat-roofed shop-houses. Despite the pressures, the small plots remained until the late 1970s and \u201880s, when real estate profits drew investors who bought up several plots at once to develop large, pencil towers of 20 to 30 storeys on three-storey podium bases. These linked processes of land accumulation and the gradual reduction of building parcels have been accompanied by a shift away from small-scale owner-operated businesses to a residential, middle-income community working in the nearby business districts.<\/p>\n<p>Change is likely to continue apace in Sai Ying Pun. The Island MTR line is being extended to the neighbourhood, and a public street escalator is under construction on one of the area\u2019s three main uphill streets. At the same time, Hong Kong\u2019s Urban Renewal Authority is buying up properties in the area, replacing small plots with large towers. The Island Crest development, for example, replaces 30 buildings by two high-rise towers sitting on a three-storey podium. It offers flats of much larger sizes than in older buildings (365 square metres\/1,200 square feet rather than 152 square metres\/500 square feet), which sold for approximately US$2,150 (HK$16,737) per square foot in 2011.<\/p>\n<p>These changes in the urban fabric of Sai Ying Pun are removing its network of smaller-scale voids and cracks, which provided space for social interaction, workspaces, drying areas or simply for wild plants to grow. Still, the neighbourhood remains one of Hong Kong\u2019s most complex and dramatic. The vertical cuts down to the sea between precipice buildings, dilapidated walls and the indestructible banyan tree, whose roots remain firmly wrapped around many older buildings and walls, offer glimpses of the forces that have transformed Hong Kong from a military outpost into one of the densest urban agglomerations in the world.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":null,"article_publishing_date":"November 2011","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"140","name":"Joshua","created":"2011-11-14 11:16:15","modified":"2011-11-14 11:16:15","slug":null,"family_name":"Bolchover","title":null,"email_address":null,"photo_legacy":null,"profile_text":null,"organization":null,"role":null,"additional_affiliations":null,"qualifications":null,"staff_pages_blurb":null,"office_location":null,"display_after":null,"display_until":null,"extended_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb_lang2":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation_lang2":null,"phone_number":null}],"attachments":false,"gallery":{"slug":false,"extra_classes":"","slides":[]}},{"request_language":"","current_page_uri":"\/media\/search-dev.json","lang2_slug":false,"lang2_name":false,"parent_publication_id":19,"featured_image_uri":"","article_title":"High Urban Density and the Goal of a Healthy City","permalink":"high-urban-density-and-the-goal-of-a-healthy-city","article_subtitle":"The Case of Chongqing","article_abstract":"","article_summary":"","article_text":"<p>As an inland city, some 2,253 kilometres (1,400 miles) up the Yangtze from the sea, Chongqing lacked the access to the most lucrative markets and trading routes that accelerated Shanghai\u2019s evolution as a major city from the Opium War (1840) onward. With a small concession zone after 1891, Chongqing was not cosmopolitan until 1937\u201346, when it served as the Nationalist capital, and when its population exceeded 1.7 million by the founding of the People\u2019s Republic in 1949. With this demographic expansion, Chongqing, once known as the &#8216;City of Mountains and Fog&#8217;, became one of the most crowded cities in China, where people lived compactly along steep river banks and narrow lanes. This high density, coupled with a mountainous terrain and limited flat land, set the basic parameters of the challenges faced by Chongqing in trying to build a &#8216;healthy city&#8217; today, which is one of five goals set by the municipal government in 2008 to improve living conditions of Chongqing people.<\/p>\n<p>Like all major cities in China, the basic indicators on health for Chongqing have improved steadily. Average life expectancy of Chongqing residents rose from about 40 years in 1949 to 76 today (lower than Shanghai\u2019s, see &#8216;Urbanisation and Disea\u00ad\u00adse Patterns in Shanghai&#8217; by Youde Guo), with most of the gain during the era of central planning and state-sponsored health care. However, as an index of high residential density, living space per capita remained very low at nearly 4 square metres (13 square feet) by 1980. The post-1980 economic reform did not significantly boost Chongqing\u2019s development until 1997, when it became a direct municipality under the central government. Since the 1990s, Chongqing has followed Hong Kong and Singapore in building high-rise apartments of up to 30 storeys or more with floor area ratios (FAR) of up to 4.0\u20134.5. This recent and massive residential construction helped raise the average living space per capita to 31.7 metres (104 feet) by 2010, even despite the rapid population growth during that period. This large living space reflects Chongqing\u2019s distinctive spatial make-up among China\u2019s largest cities. While the larger metropolitan region comprises 82,000 square kilometres (269,028 square feet) and 28.9 million people, some ten million of those residents live in Chongqing\u2019s principal urban area of just 2,700 square kilometres (8,858 square feet), resulting in a much higher density than its vast rural hinterland. While each urban resident enjoys more spacious living, the overall density has increased dramatically with the vertical build-up of residential towers, similar to that of Shanghai. However, to tackle the challenge of high-density urban life to health conditions, Chongqing has pursued more explicit policies than Shanghai.<\/p>\n<p>Of the &#8216;Five Goals for Chongqing&#8217; unveiled by the municipal government in 2008, three \u2013 livability, reforestation and good health \u2013 were intended to create a healthy living environment. To achieve the specific goal of a healthy Chongqing, the government plans to build sport facilities en masse and improve medical services rapidly with a wider coverage of medical insurance (free limited medical service for both the employed and the unemployed) in order to benefit local residents. This medical insurance system is a preliminary and progressive one but without very strong financial backing from the government for the moment. However, the government has committed more aid to the more vulnerable social groups with little or no medical insurance. Included in these policies was the concrete target of adding another year to the current life expectancy by 2012.<\/p>\n<p>Complementary policies included an ambitious tree planting programme, begun in 2010 at a cost of HK$1.6 billion, the construction of massive new green spaces, a large number of new public parks and clustered urban districts interlaced within the existing topography of mountains and rivers. Another major plan involves building 17 new light-rail and subway lines (three of which are already in operation) in order to improve public transportation and reduce air pollution from growing car traffic, while more pedestrian walkways and &#8216;healthy footpaths&#8217; have been built in many neighbourhoods. All these efforts to improve residents\u2019 living conditions have won general praise from among both the upper and lower classes.<\/p>\n<p>While it will be sometime before the intended effects of these policies can materialise in improved general health conditions, they share a prominent focus on livability, and are backed up by serious financial commitment. They also reflect an official recognition of the inescapable high density in a constrained mountainous and hilly topography, and therefore the importance of large-scale planning and engineering to mitigate its perceived undesirable impact on health. Underpinning this approach is an aesthetic rationale that a greener city that is more integrated with the natural topography of the surrounding mountains and the two rivers (the Yangtze and Jialing rivers meet at the tip of the peninsula on which Chongqing\u2019s urban core sits) is more beautiful and also healthier. Although beautifying Chongqing through forestation and greening public spaces has enhanced the surface appearance of the city, it has run into some unintended consequences, including rapid real estate construction, with its partial end result of lowering indoor density.<\/p>\n<p>Given Chongqing\u2019s land and topographic constraints, residential real estate development takes shape in large numbers of high-rise apartment towers tightly bunched together on hilltops and along river banks. The monotonous skyline, worsened by the often foggy sky, appears to overshadow the greener and more pleasing cityscape and natural beauty of a mountainous river city. Still, the massive supply of new housing has raised residential living space per capita. However, the profit motive of real estate developers tends to push construction to the high or luxury end of the market, inflating housing prices so that lower-income buyers are priced out of the market. In the northern part of Chongqing city, luxury villa developments with golf courses for the nouveau riche were permitted by the local authorities in spite of the ban from the central government. In response, the current municipal government started an ambitious social housing programme at a cost of roughly UK$40 billion to make 40 million square kilometres (130 million square feet) of living space available to low-income residents within three years. Each of these apartments is limited to 60 square kilometres (196 square feet) and yields 20 square kilometres (65\u00bd square feet) per capita for a family of three. Its huge scope helps keep the indoor density relatively low, even though outdoor density in terms of people\u2013land ratio is relatively high. The first low-rent high-rise housing development in Chongqing, Minxin Jiayuan (Folk Wish Homes), was finished in 2010, where thousands of low-income families have moved, with decent and spacious outdoor environment and facilities.<\/p>\n<p>The rapid increase in housing prices in Chongqing has complicated and compromised government efforts to beautify the city, improve the quality of life and to create significant affordable housing. A brief reference to Hong Kong illustrates the point. About ten years ago, Hong Kong\u2019s average personal income was 30 times of Chongqing\u2019s, while the former\u2019s housing price was about 50 times higher. The Hong Kong\u2013Chongqing income ratio has since shrunk to 10:1, while the housing differential narrowed to 12:1. The shifts in these ratios mean that Chongqing\u2019s housing has become more expensive relative to income, causing per capita living space to shrink. In the 1990s, many families in Chongqing bought apartments of more than 100 square kilometres (328 square feet), but most buyers today have to settle for less than 90 square kilometres (295 square feet).<\/p>\n<p>In the compact and rapidly growing large city of Chongqing, there is limited room but greater need for smart planning to achieve the level of density that is conducive to quality of living and health. While this planning can take advantage of the natural beauty of mountains, forests and rivers, it confronts the tough challenge in reconciling with the brutal commercial logic of rapid real estate development and price inflation that is not necessarily compatible with building a healthy city.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"<p>The authors would like to acknowledge the comments and editorial support of Professor Xiangming Chen.<\/p>\n","pdf_uri":"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/11\/2011_chw_5040_Huang-Huang-Fu.pdf","article_publishing_date":"November 2011","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"124","name":"Tianqi","created":"2011-11-04 11:37:13","modified":"2011-11-04 11:37:13","slug":null,"family_name":"Huang","title":null,"email_address":null,"photo_legacy":null,"profile_text":null,"organization":null,"role":null,"additional_affiliations":null,"qualifications":null,"staff_pages_blurb":null,"office_location":null,"display_after":null,"display_until":null,"extended_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb_lang2":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation_lang2":null,"phone_number":null},{"id":"125","name":"Ling","created":"2011-11-04 11:37:34","modified":"2011-11-04 11:37:34","slug":null,"family_name":"Huang","title":null,"email_address":null,"photo_legacy":null,"profile_text":null,"organization":null,"role":null,"additional_affiliations":null,"qualifications":null,"staff_pages_blurb":null,"office_location":null,"display_after":null,"display_until":null,"extended_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb_lang2":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation_lang2":null,"phone_number":null},{"id":"126","name":"Jianfeng","created":"2011-11-04 11:37:53","modified":"2011-11-04 11:37:53","slug":null,"family_name":"Xu","title":null,"email_address":null,"photo_legacy":null,"profile_text":null,"organization":null,"role":null,"additional_affiliations":null,"qualifications":null,"staff_pages_blurb":null,"office_location":null,"display_after":null,"display_until":null,"extended_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb_lang2":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation_lang2":null,"phone_number":null}],"attachments":false,"gallery":{"slug":false,"extra_classes":"","slides":[]}},{"request_language":"","current_page_uri":"\/media\/search-dev.json","lang2_slug":false,"lang2_name":false,"parent_publication_id":19,"featured_image_uri":"","article_title":"High-Density Living In Hong Kong","permalink":"high-density-living-in-hong-kong","article_subtitle":null,"article_abstract":"","article_summary":"","article_text":"<p>The urban area of Hong Kong has the highest population and employment density in the world. Measured at block level, some areas may have population densities of more than 400,000 people per square kilometre. As of 2011, there are seven million people for its 1,068 square kilometres (412 square miles) of land. However, more than 75 per cent of this land comprises no-built-up areas. The high concentration of people in just a few square kilometres is due partly to the fact that new town development did not take place until well into the 1970s and therefore most of the population (which had experienced a post-war boom in the 1950s) had to be accommodated in the main<br \/> urban area along the waterfront of the Victoria Harbour on Hong Kong Island. The high price of land in Hong Kong also contributes to its high-density development. Those on low and middle incomes, and even some on high incomes, can only afford to live in high-rise buildings. Despite its very high density, Hong Kong is a still a very livable city compared to other large cities in the world.<br \/> There is a myth that high population density is undesirable and often associated with social pathologies and problems. However, only studies on animals have proven this association. There is little correlation between density and social pathology \u2013 deviant behaviour, crime and suicide \u2013 when other socioeconomic variables are considered. There are many factors affecting social pathology in which density is just one. Other factors such as socioeconomic background, educational background and the health of individuals are more important variables than density in explaining social pathology.<br \/> It is important here to distinguish between \u2018density\u2019 and \u2018crowding\u2019. While \u2018density\u2019 is used to refer to the physical limitation of space, \u2018crowding\u2019 is the<br \/> actual psychological perception of the limitation of space. Social pathology is caused by the stress and social conflict of crowding, but high density does not necessarily lead to a perception of crowding or stress. Robert Mitchell found that stress in Hong Kong may be more likely due to inadequate income or forced social interaction between non-relatives in shared flats than density itself.<br \/> Each individual may perceive crowding differently. For example, given a fixed density environment, individuals who once lived in a denser environment will perceive it to be less crowded than those who did not. Additionally, studies have shown that Asians and Chinese were found to have a high adaptation and tolerance to crowding. In Hong Kong itself, many studies have shown that a substantial proportion of the urban population did not see high density as a problem, many even preferred the presence of a large number of people. The tolerance of Hong Kong people towards high densities could also be explained by their previous living environments, since many residents are refugees and may have experienced worse living conditions prior to moving to Hong Kong.<br \/> High density has many advantages. It can create more efficient land use and is more cost-effective in providing public services and facilities. In terms of transportation, Hong Kong has one of the lowest energy consumption per capita in the world. High density maximises the effectiveness of public transport while minimising the distance between the sites of day-to-day activities. It also reduces energy and infrastructure costs.<br \/> The negative effects of density can be mitigated by the design, layout, open spaces, traffic and community facilities of both external and personal spaces. For external space, with a fixed density, people will have a sensation of less crowdedness if there is more open space, less traffic congestion and more community facilities.<br \/> Since the 1980s, Hong Kong has emerged as a major commercial and financial centre in Asia. Office space in Central district, for example, has increased through new buildings on reclaimed land and the redevelopment of old buildings into new office blocks. Although there is an increase in employment density, there is no major increase in crowding. This can be attributed to better planning and density management. The government has encouraged the construction of public amenities in exchange for increased floor space in new buildings by granting developers a \u2018bonus plot ratio\u2019. Thus many new buildings in Central have been designed to include public spaces or public passageways. Central is interconnected by a large and sophisticated pedestrian system that separates pedestrians from vehicle traffic, making travelling from one place to another more comfortable and less stressful.<br \/> The planning and development of new towns has also improved the high-rise living environments of more than 50 per cent of the people living there. With a density slightly less than that of the old urban areas in Hong Kong Island or Kowloon, the more spacious layout between buildings and well-planned open spaces have made such high-density environments a far better place to live.<br \/> Over the past few years, Hong Kong has developed the following planning, design and management measures to continue improving its high-rise living environments:<\/p>\n<p><em>External environment of buildings<\/em><br \/> 1) Better planning and design so that buildings are positioned further apart and have more open space;<br \/> 2) Improved transport management by prioritising the development of mass transit and focusing on pedestrian movement in order to keep traffic congestion in check;<br \/> 3) Creation of space by fully utilising the already-existing areas within buildings, such as roof tops and podiums, and transforming them into community and recreational spaces;<br \/> 4) A trend towards large-scale property developments, which allows a greater consolidation of space in order to provide community facilities and ease of movement between locales;<br \/> 5) The use of new building technology and materials to break the monotony of a district, while outdoor escalators facilitate the movement of pedestrians; and<br \/> 6) Public education campaigns to encourage people to contribute to maintaining a clean environment.<\/p>\n<p><em>Interior environment of buildings<\/em><br \/> 1) Improved building management and maintenance to create a clean and safe living environment;<br \/> 2) New building design, large lobby spaces in large-scale property developments have provided a greater sense of openness in interior building environments; and<br \/> 3) Escalators and express lifts to help people move more quickly around buildings.<br \/> Through better planning, design and management of the built environment, Hong Kong demonstrates how a large population can be accommodated in a small area without impairing quality of life. Better planning, design and management can reduce the impact of high density, making the living and working environment less crowded. Citizens also have to be educated to know how to behave in public spaces in high-density areas. Planners, architects, urban managers, communities and citizens all have to work together to make high-density living livable. Experience in Hong Kong shows that high density, if better planned and managed, can be an interesting and pleasant environment. Though an extreme case, Hong Kong can provide lessons for cities worldwide. As the world\u2019s population expands and continually urbanises, a sustainable means of accommodating the growing urban population in a livable manner will be needed.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/11\/2011_chw_3050_Yeh.pdf","article_publishing_date":"November 2011","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"110","name":"Anthony G.

These homes and living spaces are usually less than 9.3 square metres (100 square feet) in size, but cage homes tend to be just 1.9 square metres (20 square feet). Residents living in these habitats include the working poor, the unemployed, new immigrants, people suffering from mental illness, ex-offenders and other marginalised and socially excluded groups. These residents face multiple housing-related problems, including poor ventilation, small living spaces, stressful relationships with their neighbours and, despite the poor quality accommodation, unaffordable rents.<\/p>\n<p>Over the last 30 years, the Society for Community Organization (SoCO) has been working with grassroots groups to fight for reasonable living standards in Hong Kong. SoCO individually visits poor households and follows up on their needs, helping them to fight for public housing allocation and livelihood protection. Each year, the organisation assists 1,000 low-income cage home residents to obtain public housing allocations and provides housing, employment and financial consulting services. Despite our successful lobbying for a number of policy changes, inadequate housing remains a significant problem in Hong Kong. In order to help increase awareness of the difficulties faced by poor urban residents, we have compiled a series of short profiles of cubicle and cage home dwellers. These portraits provide a sense for what life is like for some of the residents of Hong Kong\u2019s cubicles and cage homes.<\/p>\n<h3>Portraits from Hong Kong\u2019s cubicles and cage homes<\/h3>\n<p>In Sham Shui Po, an older district in Kowloon, Mr and Mrs Wu live in a small cubicle: a 4.6-square-metre (50-square-foot) apartment so small that it is difficult even to turn round, containing no other furniture than a bed, and no electrical appliances. The tiny cubicle is extremely hot in the summer. As Mr Wu said, \u2018There is only one window, but I dare not open it, as it is full of rubbish outside. The temperature is well over 30 degrees now. I have to go up to the rooftop to sleep every night. It is just too hot to sleep inside.\u2019 Sixteen-year-old Wing lives in a neighbouring cubicle with his parents and younger sister, which costs them US$193 (HK$1,500) per month of the household\u2019s monthly income of US$514 (HK$4,000). Wing says, \u2018After school, we bring two chairs up to the rooftop and do our homework. We don\u2019t have a desk at our home, so we use the chairs as desks. My mum, sister and I stay up at the roof to eat and chat every evening. Sometimes, we play games up there too, and then go back to our cubicle after 11pm to sleep. Yes, the roof is full of trash, as long as you don\u2019t look at them, it\u2019s no problem.&#8217;<\/p>\n<p>Rooftop living is equally challenging. Lau Yip Sum, aged eight, lives in a 9.3-square-metre (100-square-foot) cubicle on a rooftop with his family. Here, too, temperatures can be very high, and his family cannot switch on the air-conditioning continuously, which makes Yip Sum reluctant to go home. Fortunately, a social worker helped him to access free tutorial class at the Community Learning Centre, which provided him a more comfortable place to study after school. Yet, when at home, living conditions are far from healthy: \u2018Toilet, ceiling \u2026 in any area you can see cockroaches and mice, and sometimes they are dead!\u2019 said the scared and helpless Yip Sum. His health has deteriorated, and he falls ill easily: he was ill with a fever for several days and caught pneumonia in the previous year, and his eye was wounded by his younger brother at night when they were asleep in their narrow bed. The family has been waiting for public rental housing for more than three years and it is still not clear when a flat will be found for them.<\/p>\n<p>For 54-year-old Chau Kam-chuen, the economic decline that followed the 2003 SARS outbreak in Hong Kong forced his employers to reduce his working hours as a chef, following which he reluctantly retired and was unable to find other work. He fell into financial difficulty, and was forced to take up increasingly poor housing: \u2018I used to make over HK$10,000 [US$1,286] a month, and was using HK$2,000 [US$257] for rent. I became unemployed and used up my savings. When the landlord raised the rent, I moved in to a HK$1,500 [US$193] [per month] cubicle; then the landlord there raised the rent too! Since September 2007, I have been paying HK$900 [US$116] [per month] for an illegal caged bed space of less than 20 square feet [1.9 square metres]\u2019. Having been promoted from waiter, to headwaiter and later chef during the \u2018golden era\u2019 of the 1980s and &#8217;90s, Chau is now relying on Comprehensive Social Security Assistance (CSSA). Although he has been living in Sham Shui Po for more than 20 years, this is the first time he has had to share an enclosed living space of 74.3 square metres (800 square feet) with nearly 40 other people, breathing stale air and queuing up for hours to use the toilet. When he first moved in, Chau was living through a period of depression, until SoCO found him: \u2018Soon after I moved in, social workers came and visited. I didn\u2019t trust them at first, didn\u2019t think they could help me, I couldn\u2019t help myself.\u2019 After a few more visits, he opened up and has become friends with others who share similar past experiences: \u2018I\u2019ve become more positive since then.\u2019 His major concern is now finding a job. Chau is a strong man in his fifties, but most of his teeth are gone, and finding a job is not an easy task for him. \u2018No boss will employ me. It\u2019s just so sad.\u2019 Chau has had many frustrating job-hunting experiences, but he is determined not to give up. &#8216;If I have a job, I don\u2019t need to rely on CSSA. I\u2019ll work hard and support myself. I can then move to a bigger place, a place with more privacy.\u2019<\/p>\n<p>Fung Kam-ho, a 43-year-old unemployed waitress, has a \u2018suite\u2019 of just 9.3 square metres (100 square feet). She has suffered mental health problems, following a breakdown in 2004, and now relies on public assistance and has applied for Compassionate Rehousing in a public housing estate. Kam-ho\u2019s neighbours are mostly prostitutes and second-hand goods traders but, compared to the cubicle she lived in for decades previously, it is indeed a great improvement. There, seven or eight people lived under the same roof, but Kam-ho was the only female and lived in fear. She admits that her mental condition was very bad when she was staying there, and while she wanted to move, living on public assistance, she did not have many choices and could only move from one cubicle in Sham Shui Po to another, and all were just as shabby and worn-out as each other. Now Kam-ho\u2019s wish is to gain access to public housing, so that she can have a place of her own, a bathroom, a kitchen and a living environment that is not as lousy as her present one, and to have a new start.<\/p>\n<h3>Inadequate housing and health<\/h3>\n<p>As these portraits suggest, living in inadequate housing is likely to have a detrimental impact on residents\u2019 physical and mental health, which may already be poor in many cases. This is backed up by research conducted by SoCO since 1990 on cage homes and cubicles, which shows that chronic illnesses are common amongst residents, with only 21 per cent of cubicle residents and 31 per cent of cage home residents surveyed not suffering any chronic illness. Respiratory disease is one of the most common chronic illnesses and, while the precise numbers have varied, respiratory diseases have tended to rank high in SoCO\u2019s different studies across the years. For example, 22.2 per cent of cubicle residents and 22.6 per cent of cage home residents surveyed in 2009 were suffering from respiratory disease.<\/p>\n<p>Such high rates of disease are not difficult to understand in light of residents\u2019 over-crowded living areas, which facilitate the transmission of germs. They also reflect the concentration of socially excluded groups in inadequate housing: the \u2018dumping ground\u2019 for groups such as ex-offenders, drug-abusers and people suffering mental illness. These groups made up 31.1 per cent of inadequate housing residents in 1997 but only 14.4 per cent in 2009, thanks in part to the improvements in housing policy successfully lobbied for by SoCO. Despite a reduction in the percentage of residents living in inadequate housing that have severe mental illness, from 8.9 per cent in 1997 to 5.2 per cent in 2009, these figures remain significantly higher than for the city as a whole. When surveyed by SoCO, 40 per cent of people with mental illness said that their mental health had worsened as a result of living in inadequate housing. Again, this impact is not difficult to understand in light of the small spaces in which people are living, and the stressful relationships they have with their neighbours, who must also share such spaces.<\/p>\n<p>The results of SoCO\u2019s research are consistent with official statistics. Poor people in Hong Kong are more likely to rate their own health as fair or poor than other income groups: nearly 47.7 per cent of people with \u2018no income\u2019 and 40.1 per cent of people earning less than US$1,286 (HK$10,000). The same findings arise from other physical and mental health assessments: the median scores for physical health as assessed by the \u2018SF-12\u2019 scheme, for example, are 47.7 for people with \u2018no income\u2019, 50.5 for people earning less than US$1,286 and 51.4 for people earning US$2,572 (HK$20,000) or more. SoCO\u2019s own analysis of the differences in mental health (as measured by the CES-D scheme) by district found that mental health was significantly worse in Kwun Tong (CES-D score of 29.0), Sham Shui Po (22.0) and Yau Tsim Mong (25.0) than in Hong Kong as a whole (17.0). These three districts are old urban areas in Hong Kong, where much inadequate housing is concentrated.While the study is not conclusive, and does not prove any causal relationship, it is at least an attempt to fill a gap in the official statistics to explore the relationships between inadequate housing and mental health within Hong Kong.<\/p>\n<p>SoCO\u2019s research is also consistent with various academic studies in Hong Kong and elsewhere on the relationships between housing and physical and mental health. The transmission of tuberculosis in Hong Kong, for example, has been found to be facilitated by crowded living conditions in rooms and bedsits, as well as being a disease of the poor more generally. The connections between poor housing and mental health have been explored internationally, and various correlations between housing quality and mental wellness have been identified. The subject has, however, received relatively little attention in Hong Kong:the only available local study, conducted in 1971, is now rather out-of-date.<\/p>\n<h3>Recognising and acting on Hong Kong\u2019s housing problem<\/h3>\n<p>Unfortunately, the Hong Kong SAR Government does not approach the issue of housing through a health perspective. For, while the government has promised to house public housing applicants within three years, many applicants have to wait much longer due to various discriminatory housing policies, as well as a lack of supply. New immigrant families may have to wait seven years, because they are regarded as non-permanent Hong Kong residents, while non-elderly single people have to wait for more than ten years as a result of the government\u2019s efforts to control demand by limiting the supply of public housing for single people. Despite the 50 per cent increase in public housing applications from around 100,000 in 2006 to around 150,000 in 2011, the government only promises to build 15,000 public housing units per year in the coming years. Residents\u2019 health is thus ignored by housing policy, which forces them to remain for long periods of time in poor living environments while they wait helplessly for public housing.<\/p>\n<p>To improve the health of residents living in inadequate housing, the government should start by commissioning a comprehensive study on health and housing in order to understand and recognise the nature and extent of the problem. This study should then trigger a review of existing housing policy, considering changes such as shortening the waiting time for public housing, subsidising residents of inadequate housing to enable them to live in a healthier living environment while they wait, enhancing primary health care and rehabilitation services and, in particular, initiatives that focus on socially excluded groups.<\/p>\n<p>The evidence linking poor housing and health is clear, yet the issue receives little attention in Hong Kong. Unless this is recognised, and the related complex problems of poverty, insufficient housing supply and lack of social support are adequately addressed by the government, the health of Hong Kong\u2019s residents will remain in danger.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/11\/2011_chw_5010_SoCO.pdf","article_publishing_date":"November 2011","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"138","name":"Society for","created":"2011-11-04 17:17:10","modified":"2011-11-04 17:17:10","slug":null,"family_name":"Community Organization","title":null,"email_address":null,"photo_legacy":null,"profile_text":null,"organization":null,"role":null,"additional_affiliations":null,"qualifications":null,"staff_pages_blurb":null,"office_location":null,"display_after":null,"display_until":null,"extended_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb_lang2":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation_lang2":null,"phone_number":null}],"attachments":false,"gallery":{"slug":false,"extra_classes":"","slides":[]}},{"request_language":"","current_page_uri":"\/media\/search-dev.json","lang2_slug":false,"lang2_name":false,"parent_publication_id":19,"featured_image_uri":"","article_title":"Hong Kong's spatial DNA","permalink":"hong-kongs-spatial-dna","article_subtitle":null,"article_abstract":"","article_summary":"","article_text":"<p>Hong Kong\u2019s consistent high-rise urban form and extreme population densities mark the city\u2019s urban landscape. In many other cities, a journey outwards from the centre is often accompanied by a shift towards sprawling, low-density suburban development that encroaches on the countryside. Not so in Hong Kong, which is dense and compact throughout the urban region, save for its protected mountainous areas, country parks and wetlands. This is the intended outcome of the government\u2019s tight land regulation policy and investment in a series of new towns, designed from the 1950s onwards to accommodate Hong Kong\u2019s growing population in the New Territories that separate Hong Kong Island and Kowloon from mainland China. Today more than half of Hong Kong\u2019s seven million inhabitants live in the New Territories, approximately two million (30 per cent) live in Kowloon and 1.3 million (19 per cent) on Hong Kong Island (see map below).<\/p>\n<p>While for decades the city-state acted as a quasi-autonomous outpost on the edge of Asia, today Hong Kong marks the southern gateway of a highly urbanised region extending along the Pearl River from Shenzhen to Ghuangzhou \u2013 one of the world\u2019s largest and most dispersed urban agglomerations, home to almost 50 million people. With its dense and continuous urban structure, Hong Kong provides a strong regional contrast, reflecting its unique historical conditions and system of government. Around 45 per cent of Hong Kong\u2019s population live in areas with densities of more than 50,000 people per square kilometre. This is approximate to the peak densities found in New York (58,500 people per square kilometre) and Mexico City (49,000 people per square kilometre). Only 6 per cent of Hong Kong\u2019s population lives in areas with less than 5,000 people per square kilometre, compared to 36 per cent in London.<\/p>\n<p>Hong Kong\u2019s high-density neighbour-hoods are made up of different building types (all apartment blocks of some shape or another) that reflect the architectural tastes and technical and material capacities of successive development cycles from the early twentieth century onwards: from the earlier perimeter block \u2018walk-ups\u2019, to post-World War II \u2018slabs\u2019 and \u2018double-tube\u2019 towers and the more recent \u2018star-shaped\u2019 towers (see facing page). Apart from the different benefits that come with being located in particular central or peripheral areas and from having access to good public transport \u2013 something available to most Hong Kongers to varying degrees \u2013 each building type provides advantages and disadvantages to their residents in terms of room and apartment sizes, access to daylight and fresh air, public space and other amenities. LSE Cities carried out an in-depth study of these typologies in 25 areas across Hong Kong to understand the differences between the ways in which high density has been designed, before selecting three of these areas for more detailed analysis of how residents feel living in these high-density environments affects their health and well-being.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps the city\u2019s most distinctive architectural form is the \u2018star-shaped\u2019 tower that marks the skyline of many central areas in Hong Kong Island and Kowloon, as well as the edges of the New Territories. Reaching 35 storeys in height, they are often clustered together at extremely close quarters but tend to be designed around ground level open spaces with play and sports facilities for the residents. While these developments do not create a finely structured grid pattern, the lower-rise perimeter blocks that define many of the older parts of the city do generate a continuous active street frontage. Residents of these older areas do not, however, enjoy the use of dedicated open spaces, even though small pockets may be available between blocks \u2013 often creatively adapted for play, relaxation or commerce. Although these \u2018walk-ups\u2019 rarely reach more than ten floors, the buildings optimise the development potential to the full \u2013 and often even more than that \u2013 by occupying the entire plot. Internally, the theme of space optimisation is visible in the informal and often illegal sub-division of flats into smaller flats and cubicles, providing relatively affordable but poor-quality, cramped accommodation. Sham Shui Po and the surrounding areas in Kowloon concentrate many of these buildings and its residents have contributed to the focus group interviews described on pp. 44\u20136.<\/p>\n<p>The mixed high-rise block form, where 30-storey towers co-habit with lower buildings along a distorted grid street pattern, generates some of the densest typologies in Hong Kong, with both residential and commercial activities that have come together over different time periods. The North Point area along the waterfront on Hong Kong Island, one of the city\u2019s densest spots, is defined by large scale, linear \u2018superblocks\u2019, some with tall buildings that take advantage of the views of Victoria Harbour, making up in part for the absence of well-designed public open spaces at ground level. In contrast, many of the 1960s and \u201870s developments outside the central districts of Hong Kong Island and Kowloon incorporate open spaces enclosed or surrounded by residential towers which are designed as 30-storey double tubes or ten-storey slabs.<\/p>\n<h4>High-density areas in Hong Kong<\/h4>\n<p><a href=\"\/files\/2011\/11\/2011_chw_3070_high-density-areas-in-hong-kong.gif\" rel=\"lightbox\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-961\" title=\"2011_chw_3070_high-density-areas-in-hong-kong\" src=\"\/files\/2011\/11\/2011_chw_3070_high-density-areas-in-hong-kong.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"3482\" height=\"2366\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h4>Star-shaped tower<\/h4>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_962\" style=\"width: 730px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"\/files\/2011\/11\/2011_chw_3070_01.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-962\" title=\"2011_chw_3070_01\" src=\"\/files\/2011\/11\/2011_chw_3070_01.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"354\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">1.

Buenos Aires, our closest neighbour, has with Puerto Madero succeeded in creating a high-end development on brownfield industrial land, which attracts business and visitors, despite its lack of integration within the city.<\/p>\n<p>Sites identified by the city authorities for urban regeneration, Opera\u00e7\u00f5es Urbanas (urban interventions), include areas often \u2013 but not always \u2013 adjacent to existing transport infrastructure.<\/p>\n<p>But who wins and who loses in these projects? How are these projects delivered? What institutional arrangements impact on design quality and the creation of sustainable environments? How many jobs are created? And for whom? These are the questions that S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s political, design and development communities need to address to formulate a new urban policy and to deliver a strategy to implement high quality urban design that works with the grain of the city.<\/p>\n<p>Many of the international success stories in the regeneration of large-scale sites \u2013 such as redundant ports, railway, manufacturing and transport areas \u2013 suggest that considerable levels of public investment and management are necessary to make them work. In Brazil the private sector has historically taken the lead due to the lack of public funding or involvement in urban regeneration. Yet, a long-term perspective is a prerequisite of sustainable planning as opposed to the short-term returns on investment required by any commercial operator. In Washington DC, for example, the Corporation for the Development of Pennsylvania Avenue developed a 25-year vision for the regeneration of the area. The establishment of a delivery vehicle \u2013 an administrative structure with strong public as well as private sector representation \u2013 that manages and implements the project from inception to realisation is critical to its success in promoting economic development and generating new activities.<\/p>\n<p>The compact city model, with its reduced energy footprint that promotes intensification of well-connected inner city sites, has become the central objective of many European cities. Urban containment, smart growth and sustainable development within a defined urban footprint are central components of this new urban vision that not only drives the identification of individual sites \u2013 often highly contaminated areas near the centre \u2013 but also shapes policies that promote sustainable living such as the introduction of the Congestion Charge in London or the Velib public bicycle in Paris. This approach has driven the development of a new urban hub at Paris Rive Gauche on the Eastern edge of the city \u2013 coordinated by SEMAPA (Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d&#8217;Economie Mixte de Paris) \u2013 which has attracted 60,000 jobs, counterbalancing Paris\u2019s better-known financial centre at La Defense in the West.<\/p>\n<p>Paris has developed its urban interventions within a clear regional and metropolitan perspective of economic restructuring that prioritises the international service sector, while London has focused some of its spatial policies on the creative industries through the actions of the Mayor\u2019s London Development Agency. Bilb\u00e3o, instead, developed plans at various regional and metropolitan scales before empowering the RIA2000 agency with the strategic implementation of the plan that gave rise to Frank Gehry\u2019s Guggenheim Museum, Norman Foster\u2019s metro stations and Santiago Calatrava\u2019s bridge. These interventions were instrumental elements of a successful marketing strategy that has promoted the city as tourist destination, placing it in competition with world capitals.<\/p>\n<p>The wide-scale adoption of neo-liberal ideologies and their impacts on social exclusion has led to what Neil Smith has identified as the new \u2018global strategy for gentrification\u2019. In Paris traditional, old-style policies \u2013 enshrined in the ZAC (Zones d&#8217;Amenagement Concert\u00e9s) \u2013 still constitute the legal starting point for urban and social housing projects, as they do across the whole of France. Exceptions to this rule are the implementation structures applied to the redevelopment of Paris Rive Gauche, Parc Citro\u00ebn, Bercy and the former Renault car-works area. In the case of Paris Rive Gauche, a direct confrontation with the local community resulted in the provision of an appropriate number of affordable housing units and the incorporation of an old industrial mill as the seat of this industrial mobilisation.<\/p>\n<p>The evidence from these projects points to the development of new management tools and the involvement of a wider range of social agents to better define successful urban regeneration. A key element is public transport, a critical component of sustainable urban development. Canary Wharf, the massive office and commercial complex in London\u2019s East, only took off after the Jubilee Line extension connected it to the city\u2019s main metro network. The success of the Kings Cross development and the London 2012 Olympics site in the Lower Lea Valley are also highly dependent on their location next to major rail-based transport hubs that will create higher density clusters of a polycentric nature. In Milan, the viable redevelopment of ex-industrial sites at La Bovisa and La Biccoca into major office and residential neighbourhoods were predicated on their proximity to the city\u2019s extensive public transport network.<\/p>\n<p>By analysing international case studies, it becomes clear that the state has played a key role in their implementation, despite the high level of private sector investment. Even in the United States there is evidence of substantial public investment \u2013 at federal, state and city level \u2013 to implement infrastructure, transport, public spaces and cultural institutions in major urban projects. Another lesson is that solutions to urban problems depend on the involvement of local actors, civil society and the active participation of government at many levels. On balance it can be observed that highly centralised traditional planning tools which regulate land use and urban development \u2013 as they are currently implemented in Brazil \u2013 have become obsolete.<\/p>\n<p>S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s strategic plan \u2013 the Plano Director Estrategico \u2013 is a case in point. The PDE 2000 determined that 20 per cent of its built-up area should become sites for Opera\u00e7\u00f5es Urbana (urban interventions). To date these have been the subject of repeated criticism with piecemeal results which lack a comprehensive vision of urban design. There is no vision for a sustainable urban model with clear environmental objectives, nor has there been any public debate about public space and rebalancing the role of public transport and the private car in the city\u2019s future.<\/p>\n<p>The crisis of contemporary Brazilian urbanism reflects the weakness of the system of large-scale \u2018strategic masterplans\u2019, which wrongly assume that all urban problems can be solved by one single instrument. The successful strategy for city-level \u2018urban interventions\u2019 must be considered as an instrument of structural transformation, built on a partnership between the public and private sectors. It is a process that requires the participation of landowners, investors, residents and representatives of civil society which identifies particular urban areas for transformation as part of a wider metropolitan strategy. To be implemented successfully, such a strategy requires a series of medium and long-term measures, including land tenure reform, evaluation of real estate potential, strict land use regulations and public space interventions.<\/p>\n<p>The S\u00e3o Paulo experience has since the 1990s failed to deliver an effective and democratic urban vision for the city. The major reason for this failure is the absence of a proper management and implementation vehicle that takes into account the full social and economic costs and benefits of projects of this scale and complexity. Any intervention of this sort must embrace the various actors and agents involved in the production of city space, constructing a communal fabric that values the individual citizen. Yet, this approach assumes public engagement to achieve a shared objective. Demolition of entire pieces of city and their replacement by \u2018model\u2019 projects will do little to improve the lives of existing urban dwellers, and will simply cause displacement and erosion of its existing social and urban fabric.<\/p>\n<p>Given the extreme levels of social inequality found in most Brazilian cities we would argue that a more subtle and sophisticated approach to urban regeneration is necessary: one that is based on a collective effort and broad participation, and that aims to promote local development and social inclusion. To this end we would suggest that S\u00e3o Paulo adopts a new system for the implementation of its urban interventions founded on the following principles: require a clear political commitment to implementation, innovation and inclusion through a metropolitan masterplan that integrates the development potential of urban sites with public transport provision; establish a legal framework that promotes social inclusion and public participation (by creating a Participatory Management Forum for individual urban projects); establish an independent local development agency to implement specific urban projects, that includes all key stakeholders and is responsible for project management and delivery, inward investment, funding and project financing; develop an integrated mobility plan that optimises public transport use incorporating metro, bus, bicycle and pedestrian movements and minimises private car dependency; establish a metropolitan-wide development fund that can capture value of future return on investments; promote a sustainable environmental approach that integrates the remediation of water and river systems with redevelopment of brownfield land; propose mixed-use centres that provide housing and employment and support the \u2018new economy\u2019; and identify special conservation areas across the city that take into account the historic value and architectural merit of buildings and spaces.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":"http:\/\/v0.urban-age.net\/0_downloads\/archive\/_SA\/17_NewsPaper_Essay_Somekh-Leite.pdf","article_publishing_date":"December 2008","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"17","name":"Carlos","created":"2011-09-01 12:11:54","modified":"2011-09-01 13:11:54","slug":"carlos","family_name":"Leite","title":null,"email_address":null,"photo_legacy":null,"profile_text":"","organization":"","role":"","additional_affiliations":null,"qualifications":null,"staff_pages_blurb":null,"office_location":null,"display_after":null,"display_until":null,"extended_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb_lang2":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation_lang2":null,"phone_number":null}],"attachments":false,"gallery":{"slug":false,"extra_classes":"","slides":[]}},{"request_language":"","current_page_uri":"\/media\/search-dev.json","lang2_slug":"pt-br","lang2_name":"Portuguese (Brasil)","parent_publication_id":41,"featured_image_uri":"","article_title":"In the Violent Favelas of Brazil","permalink":"in-the-violent-favelas-of-brazil","article_subtitle":"","article_abstract":"","article_summary":"<p>As Rio de Janiero\u2019s urban neighbourhoods change, Suketu Mehta explores the impact on the daily lives of city dwellers.<\/p>\n","article_text":"<p>My Brazilian friend Marina and I were picking up a visiting friend from New York, who heads an NGO, in her hotel lobby near Paulista, the most prestigious avenue in S\u00e3o Paulo. It was 7.30pm on a busy Friday night last October. We walked up to a taxi outside the hotel. I sat in the front to let the two women chat in the back. I saw a teenage boy run up to the taxi and gesticulate through my open window. I thought he was a beggar, asking for money. Then I saw the gun, going from my head to the cell phone.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u2018Just give him the phone,\u2019 Marina said from the back seat.<br \/>\nI gave him the phone. He didn\u2019t go away.<br \/>\n\u2018Dinheiro, dinheiro!\u2019<br \/>\nI didn\u2019t want to give him my wallet. The boy was shouting obscenities. \u2018Dinheiro, dinheiro!\u2019<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The boy\u2019s body suddenly jerked back, as a man\u2019s arm around his neck pulled him off his feet. The man, dressed in a black shirt, was shouting; he had jumped the boy from behind. He started hitting the boy. The taxi driver sitting next to me was stoic. He said that this had never happened to him before, but he couldn\u2019t have been more blas\u00e9.<\/p>\n<p>The next thing I saw was the boy and another teenager, probably his accomplice, running away fast up the street. The man in the black shirt chased them a bit, then came back panting to the taxi. \u2018Did the bastard get anything?\u2019 our saviour &#8230; asked. He wasn\u2019t a plainclothes cop, as I\u2019d originally thought; he was just an ordinary citizen who was tired of the criminals. The taxi driver drove us to the nearest police station. Two lethargic cops were the only people there. \u2018We get ten of these a day, just in this precinct,\u2019 said one of them. The other cop went over to check in his register. \u2018Three before you today.\u2019 There are 319 armed robberies a day in S\u00e3o Paulo.<\/p>\n<p>Everyone in this country has a story. The cities of Brazil are some of the most violent places in the world today. More people are murdered in Brazil than in almost any other country. In 2010, there were 43,684 murders, 22 per 100,000 inhabitants, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), compared to the global rate of 6.9 or to London\u2019s rate of 1.6 (in 2009). Between 5 to 8 per cent of Brazilian homicides are solved \u2013 compared to 65 per cent of murders in the US and 90 per cent of murders in the UK. Most of the victims are male and poor, between 15 and just shy of 30. The homicide rate has shaved seven years off the life expectancy in the Rio <em>favelas<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>The violence hasn\u2019t prevented Brazil from emerging on the world stage as the preeminent country in Latin America. Next year, it will host the World Cup, two years after that the Olympics. Between 2003 and 2011, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva \u2013 Lula \u2013 Brazil\u2019s remarkable president, brought about one reform after another that improved the country\u2019s economy. Rousseff, his successor, was until the protests of this June favoured to win a second term next year. Both she and Lula are from the centre-left Workers\u2019 Party. Now, while not growing as fast as it did in the days before the crisis of 2008, the economy is still the world\u2019s seventh largest.<\/p>\n<p>Brazilians like to think of themselves as a multiracial society, but a walk around the <em>favelas<\/em> of the cities demolishes this myth. Most of the residents have a dark complexion, much darker than most of the rich who live by the water or in the suburbs, and darker than most of the young people who have recently been protesting in the streets. Over the last year and a half, I have been visiting S\u00e3o Paulo and, especially, Rio de Janeiro, observing the process of \u2018pacification\u2019, by which the government attempts to peacefully enter and re-establish state control over the most violent enclaves of the city; those dominated by drug gangs, called traficantes, or by syndicates of corrupt police called <em>mil\u00edcias<\/em>. Until 2008, when the pacification programme started, the <em>traficantes<\/em> controlled roughly half of the <em>favelas<\/em>, and the <em>mil\u00edcias<\/em> the other half. Both still hold power in most <em>favelas<\/em>. The ultimate aim of the state government of Rio\u2019s plan, called the Unidade de Pol\u00edcia Pacificadora (UPP), or Police Pacification Unit, is to drive both of these groups out and replace them by the state.<\/p>\n<p>Today, of Rio\u2019s 6.3 million people, 1.4 million live in the <em>favelas<\/em>. There are some 630 of them, containing more than a thousand \u2018communities\u2019. The state government aims to \u2018pacify\u2019 40 of these <em>favelas<\/em> by the time of the World Cup next year \u2013 a kind of demonstration effect that will get attention from visitors. Since the programme started in 2008, 33 have been pacified \u2013 that is, they are under the control of the official police forces, not the drug dealers or the <em>mil\u00edcias<\/em>. In the past, the police would raid individual <em>favelas<\/em>, capture or kill the biggest drug dealers, and leave. They would soon be replaced by other dealers, and the violence would continue. \u2018The new strategy is not to target individual drug dealers. It is to take back territory,\u2019 a high-ranking police official told me.<\/p>\n<p>Under the UPP program, elite police units \u2013 and in some cases troops from the army and even the navy \u2013 invade the <em>favelas<\/em> and stay for up to three months. Then they are replaced by the regular police and squads of UPP civil servants. The UPP establishes schools and rubbish collection, brings in public and private companies to provide utilities such as electricity and television, and hands out legal documents such as employment and residency certificates. In the areas under its control, the UPP has set up community security councils, which attempt to mediate conflicts between local hotheads before they spread. The message is: the State is here to stay. So far, the programme has generally been seen as a success, and was a major factor in the re-election of S\u00e9rgio Cabral in 2010 as the state governor backed by the Workers\u2019 Party.<\/p>\n<p>One night in Rio, Walter Mesquita, a street photographer, took me to a <em>baile<\/em> funk, a street party organised by the drug dealers, in the unpacified <em>favela<\/em> of Arar\u00e1. It was an extraordinary scene: at midnight, the <em>traficantes<\/em> had cordoned off many blocks, turning the <em>favela<\/em> into a giant open-air nightclub. One end of the street was a giant wall of dozens of loudspeakers, booming songs and stories about cop-killing and underage sex. Teenagers walked around carrying AK-47s; prepubescent girls inhaled drugs and danced. On some corners, cocaine was being sold out of large plastic bags. Everybody danced: grandmothers danced, children danced, I danced. It went on until eight in the morning.<\/p>\n<p>Although such parties are officially prohibited in the pacified <em>favelas<\/em> because of their multiple breaches of the law, ranging from noise violations to exhortations to murder \u2013 even the music played there is called <em>baile<\/em> funk <em>proibid\u00e3o<\/em> \u2013 the State and its forces were nowhere to be seen. The rival gangs were a bigger threat than the police. The three gangs that control much of Rio have remained more or less stable for the last couple of decades: the Red Command, the [Pure] Third Command, and Friends of Friends. According to a top police official I spoke to, in a city of just over 6 million there are some 30 to 40 thousand people in the gangs.<\/p>\n<p>The day after the <em>baile<\/em> funk, I was flying in a police helicopter over Rio. It took us over Ipanema and the newly pacified <em>favela<\/em> of Rocinha. I asked if we could fly over Arar\u00e1. The pilot pointed it out in the distance, and said he could not fly directly over it. He was concerned about getting shot down. A couple of years ago, the <em>traficantes<\/em> had brought down a police helicopter with anti-aircraft guns. So the police cannot safely enter a large part of Rio by land or by air. This, too, is the future of many megacities in the developing world, from Nairobi to Caracas. There is a de facto sharing of power between the legitimate organs of the state and the gangs, the <em>mil\u00edcias<\/em>. Many people will die as the exact contours of this power sharing are negotiated.<\/p>\n<p>M\u00e1rio S\u00e9rgio Duarte is the high-raking police official who led the invasion of Alem\u00e3o, one of the largest and most dangerous <em>favelas<\/em> in Rio. In an eight-day operation in 2010, the police found more than 500 guns: 106 carbines, rocket launchers, bazookas, 39 Browning anti-aircraft guns. \u2018Pacification started with me,\u2019 he tells me in the bar at the top of my hotel. Duarte\u2019s mother was a seamstress, his father was murdered in 1972 over a \u2018personal dispute\u2019. Duarte studied philosophy in college, but chose to join the police force. His T-shirt says, \u2018Listen as your day unfolds\u2019.<\/p>\n<p>In the 1980s, cocaine from Colombia and Bolivia started coming into the <em>favelas<\/em>, accompanied by Eastern European AK-47s from Paraguay. A carbine, such as an AK-47 or M-15, now costs around R$15-20,000 (US$6,800-9,000). The <em>traficantes<\/em> have rocket launchers now, says Duarte, \u2018better weapons than the police,\u2019 who have .38s and 9-millimetre revolvers. Each year, some 50 cops and around 1,500 traffickers are killed. Last year, over a hundred police in S\u00e3o Paulo were murdered by the drug dealers, and police promised to kill five \u2018bad guys\u2019 for every cop killed.<\/p>\n<p>The drug trade in just one <em>favela<\/em>, Rocinha, Duarte tells me, runs to around a million R$ (US$450,000) per week. But it\u2019s not just drugs. The dealers run a parallel economy in pirated cable TV, phones, and <em>moto<\/em> taxis, and have their own systems of justice. \u2018We don\u2019t expect drugs to be stopped, just the violence with the drugs,\u2019 Duarte says. The drugs these days are ecstasy, PCP, and crystal meth, coming in from Europe. He points to Santa Marta as an example of a pacified <em>favela<\/em> where drugs are still traded, but there are no visible weapons, \u2018no king of the hill.\u2019<\/p>\n<p>The state government has increased the armed police force in Rio from 36,000 to 42,000, towards a target of 50,000, with another 10,000 \u2018civilian police\u2019&#8230; Their salaries start at R$1,500 reais (US$680) per month, and in six years go up to R$1,900 (US$860). A policeman stationed in a pacified area gets another R$500 a month to help him fight the temptation to take bribes or join one of the violent syndicates \u2013 the <em>mil\u00edcias<\/em> \u2013 run by corrupt police.<\/p>\n<p>What is happening in the <em>favelas<\/em> of Rio is not so much pacification as legalisation. The dictatorship that ruled from 1964 to 1985 was brought down after many years and great sacrifices. Everyone who was not connected to the junta was its victim. People rushed to spend their pay as soon as they got it in their hands, because by the afternoon it would be worth much less. When democracy came, everybody \u2013 the rich in Leblon and the poor in Rocinha \u2013 felt they should benefit from it, and in Brazil, for a time, most people did.<\/p>\n<p>But in the <em>favelas<\/em> there was no democracy. The traffickers continued with their own dictatorship; the people of the <em>favela<\/em> still had great trouble getting access to the courts or casting a vote. Pacification is an attempt to interrupt a despotic process. It is, for the construction workers and ladies who sell <em>feijoada<\/em> \u2013 a black bean stew \u2013 in the slum, the final fall of the dictatorship.<\/p>\n<p>During the last twenty years, the drug dealers took informal control of much of life in the <em>favelas<\/em>, including, most importantly, music, the cultural lifeblood of Brazil. \u2018Our challenge is what will happen after the pacification,\u2019 I was told by Ricardo Henriques, who was until last year the head of the Instituto Pereira Passos, the government\u2019s urban think tank that formulates policy for the UPP. As Henriques rather optimistically sees it, the takeover of the <em>favelas<\/em> will happen in three phases. The first consists of the police moving in and denying the drug dealers the ability to do what they want, legally and culturally. The second: \u2018It\u2019s a little bit boring, the police are here.\u2019 The third phase consists of the state replacing the prohibited culture by an officially sanctioned culture, or at least culture that doesn\u2019t continue to glorify rape and murder. \u2018You do it in a creative manner,\u2019 explained Henriques. \u2018No guns. Less erotic, but really creative. The music is not <em>proibid\u00e3o<\/em>.\u2019<\/p>\n<p>For decades, the <em>favelas<\/em> have existed in a parallel system to the rest of Brazil. \u2018The idea of the state is to stay there for the long, long term,\u2019 Henriques said. He wants to reduce the inequality between the <em>favela<\/em> and the rest of the city. \u2018Our challenge is to integrate those areas into the city.\u2019<\/p>\n<p>If this schematic-sounding vision of pacification works \u2013 and the ongoing protests throughout the country are putting it in doubt \u2013 what would come after it? One night I went to a jazz club in the <em>favela<\/em> of Tavares Bastos, which had been pacified for a year, right below the headquarters of the Batalh\u00e3o de Opera\u00e7\u00f5es Policiais Especiais (BOPE). The rooms of the club were packed with sweaty bodies and heavy with marijuana smoke. If the BOPE wanted to find drugs it wouldn\u2019t have to go far. But it will never come here, because these are people from the rich, white areas of Ipanema and Leblon. The only black people I could see were the saxophonist and my guide, the street photographer, who lived here. \u2018The people from the <em>favelas<\/em> can\u2019t imagine themselves here,\u2019 said the photographer. The music was bebop and bossa nova, an American idea of the jazz that Brazilians listen to. No samba here, much less funk.<\/p>\n<p>The club was opened five years ago. A beautiful white economist who works for a bank, wearing an expensive dress, told me she was already bored. \u2018Two years ago there used to be more interesting people. Now I only see all the people I would see near the beaches.\u2019 It costs R$50 (US$23) to get in; a beer is R$15 (US$7). On the way to the club, I passed a number of small caf\u00e9s. In some, neighbours were enjoying beers that cost a third as much. In one, pleasantly overweight couples were dancing close together to samba. All the lights in the houses of the <em>favela<\/em> were out; it was after midnight. But the white patrons on their way to the jazz club were raucous, laughing, energised by the thrill of the expedition to this clandestine destination.<\/p>\n<p>In Tavares Bastos, and in <em>favelas<\/em> like Cantagalo, with its easy access to the rich southern zone of Rio and increased security after the pacification, the residents are being forced out, not by violence, which they can live with, but by high rents, which will make living there impossible. Their right to live there was protected as long as it was illegal. After pacification, the biggest threat to long-time residents of the Rio <em>favelas<\/em> will come not from drug dealers, but from property dealers.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"<p>(c) 2013 The New York Review of Books\/Distributed by The New York Times Syndicate<\/p>\n","pdf_uri":"","article_publishing_date":"October 2013","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"46","name":"Suketu","created":"2011-10-07 14:30:51","modified":"2013-10-23 10:08:41","slug":"mehta-suketu","family_name":"Mehta","title":"","email_address":"","photo_legacy":"","profile_text":"Suketu Mehta is the author of <em>Maximum City: Bombay Lost and Found<\/em>, which won the Kiriyama Prize and the Hutch Crossword Award, and was a finalist for the 2005 Pulitzer Prize.

In time it will happen in India too. India today still has a rural majority, even as the world as a whole has shifted in the other direction. But, like China, India has a profound interest in maintaining its rural hinterland. Both countries are vast, and their populations account for a third of humanity. They have both, in their own ways, started to emerge from underdevelopment and have been forced to question with more or less enthusiasm some of the fundamentals of the political creeds on which their societies are based. Indian democracy and its legal system are always spoken of as the country\u2019s two key advantages in its increasingly overt competition with China. But these can be seen as handicaps as well as advantages.<\/p>\n<p>China does not want to see its cities overwhelmed, and forbids free internal movement. India\u2019s constitution guarantees it, even if the Gandhian ideology on which Indian independence was founded displayed a profound antipathy towards the idea of the city. India was to be rooted instead in the self-sufficiency of village life. It was an antipathy which easily merged with the English horror at the industrial city. The attitudes that India\u2019s Oxbridge-educated elite picked up, at first hand in some cases from Ruskin and Morris, about cities could be represented as alien creations that left incomers reduced to squalor.<\/p>\n<p>Many of India\u2019s big cities indeed have colonial roots: Calcutta, or Kolkata as it is now called, also has European foundations. Nationalist unrest drove the British to move their Imperial capital out of Calcutta and Bengal to a new site on the edges of the ancient city of Delhi in a simultaneous search for a more peaceful setting and a symbolic claim to rooting itself in Indian tradition. And it was post-colonial partition that saw the tragic population exchanges that crowded Delhi and Mumbai with refugees from Pakistan.<\/p>\n<p>India now has a hierarchy of cities spread across the country, with Mumbai, Delhi, and Bangalore the most dynamic, and experiencing the most rapid growth, while Kolkata struggles to find a wider role. But even in Mumbai, the heart of India\u2019s financial sector, 65 per cent of employment is in the informal sector, as opposed to 83 per cent in the country as a whole.<\/p>\n<p>Through the long years of India\u2019s command and control economy, its cities appeared as frozen in time as the elderly Ambassador cars built with production lines shipped from Britain. Liberalisation has ushered in an Indian middle class, attracting back the non-resident Indians, the educated diaspora, who have made their money in Silicon Valley and the Gulf, creating a potential economic superpower. Establishing fast food outlets and shopping malls \u2013 with attempts to introduce supermarkets resisted in some states by violent protests \u2013 India has begun to explore liberal market approaches to city infrastructure. And with these first results now visible, it is questioning their effectiveness.<\/p>\n<p>The new India is impatient with the things that don\u2019t work in its cities: the traffic jams, the shortcomings of infrastructure, the bureaucracy. It wants to see big changes and has invested in huge projects like Delhi\u2019s new metro system. Like China, India is finding new ways of doing things that involve profound political shifts. Even Kolkata, with its long and proud tradition as the centre of Indian Marxism and literary intellectuals, has begun to experiment with market forces. But while China is able to ignore or suppress dissent, when Bengal\u2019s farmers protested against the Special Economic Zones declared to support the industrialists wanting factories to build a 1-lakh (US$2,500) people\u2019s car, the state government had to change its mind. Bangalore and Delhi have also struggled with attempts at liberalising their approaches to planning work effectively.<\/p>\n<p>Alone among Indian cities, Kolkata has made real steps towards a genuine locally centred civic government, rather than remaining entirely in the hands of a state with a vast rural hinterland. But India\u2019s administrative complexities and its overlapping systems of state, city and federal power, mean for example that Mumbai\u2019s city government found it impossible to introduce the plan of vaccinations for all newcomers. It planned to set up reception centres at their point of entry: the railway stations in the city. But it could not do it. The city was simply unable to conclude a legally binding agreement with India\u2019s nationally-owned railway administration about the level of rent to be paid for the use of railway land. It\u2019s a nicety that is hard to conceive of in the context of China\u2019s ruthless subjugation of all other interests to state power. When it comes to something like vaccination in stations, what the party wants, the party ensures that it gets.<\/p>\n<p>For all its recurring episodes of inter-communal violence, Mumbai is a city with the ethnic, and religious diversity of a true world city. Its roots go back to the successive waves of European colonisation of India. The Portuguese handed over the cluster of islands and fishing villages that constituted Bombay to the British crown in the eighteenth century. The 20,000 inhabitants of that time have swollen to an estimated 18 million in the region today, as a port became successively a mill town, a railway hub, a financial centre, and a world centre for the cinema industry. Its architectural expression ranges from the hallucinogenic translation of high-Victorian gothic from England to the subcontinent of the Chhatrapati terminal, designed by F. W. Stevens, with the swagger of St Pancras, to the Gate of India, to in more recent times, the lyrical restraint of Charles Correa\u2019s careful synthesis of modernism with India\u2019s climate and social conditions. But these are the sharp focus landmarks in the daunting world of Mumbai\u2019s slums and hostels geared towards single male migrants and the huge red-light areas that cater for them.<\/p>\n<p>In Bangalore, rapid success has brought with it the problems of affluence. Endless commutes in India\u2019s Silicon Valley are encouraging its big IT employers to think about mixing housing with industry to achieve a more decentralised city that could help them run their businesses more efficiently. But the experience of privatised new towns here, as in Delhi, has not been encouraging. Privatised house building, based on a mirage of Southern California that is so attractive to India\u2019s affluent classes, has too often stopped at the apartment complex gate, and offered no pavement, and no transport links that can allow surrounding settlements the access that they need to provide service jobs.<\/p>\n<p>In Mumbai, a city in which water and power are erratic, in which the suburban railway network is so overcrowded that commuters who fall off the trains are killed every day, the private sector has been asked to create alternative forms of settlements that can provide solutions. All this is occurring in a highly centralised political context where, even though the councillors of Mumbai\u2019s Municipal Corporation are locally elected, the state still holds ultimate control.<\/p>\n<p>Other liberal attempts to deal with Mumbai\u2019s chronic overcrowding, its constrained site and continuing attraction to rural migrants have also been questioned, including the issue of the city\u2019s 300,000 street vendors, of whom just a few thousand are licensed.<\/p>\n<p>Yet of the 12 million residents of Greater Mumbai, almost 6.5 million live in slums. Mumbai\u2019s slums are of two kinds: the authorised, for which the municipal authority has a responsibility to provide basic services, and the unauthorised, which are subject to demolition, and for which there is no duty for the city to provide power or water. There are impossible densities, 80,000 people per km2 in Dharavi, the largest of the slums. Authorised slums are outnumbered by the 60 per cent that are illegal. Some of the illegals rely on unauthorised standpipes, and a few have no water at all.<\/p>\n<p>Mumbai is the city that inspired Sukhetu Mehta\u2019s Maximum City. It is a city unlike any other. One that offers more lessons to the world, even as it vigorously looks for ways to put India\u2019s newfound economic power to work to find its own solutions to the challenges threatening to overwhelm it.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":null,"article_publishing_date":"November 2007","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"1","name":"Deyan","created":"2011-08-23 13:50:55","modified":"2013-10-23 12:14:25","slug":"sudjic-deyan","family_name":"Sudjic","title":"","email_address":"","photo_legacy":"\/0_images\/02-DSudjic.jpg","profile_text":"<p>Deyan Sudjic is the Director of the Design Museum in London.

Currently almost 1.8 million automobiles choke its roads. Blessed with graceful natural beauty as well as a rich historical urban fabric, Istanbul faces serious challenges in trying to accommodate an additional 84,000 cars every year. This rapid increase in motor vehicles, more than eight-fold since 1980, has coincided with a dramatic population and economic growth. As a result, Istanbul is now overwhelmed by a flood of people and vehicles, an inadequate road network and a public transport system that has been slow to develop. With new overpasses and an infrastructure that favour the private car, the city struggles with air pollution, the destruction of its natural and cultural heritage and congestion. Although there are only 139 cars per 1,000 inhabitants, the average travel time for motorised trips alone has increased from 41 minutes in 1996 to 49 minutes in 2006. Like many other metropolitan cities in emerging economies, Istanbul thus suffers from high traffic congestion despite a low level of car ownership.<\/p>\n<p>Istanbul\u2019s citizens make an average number of 1.74 trips each day. This is up from 1.54 per capita in 1996. What is more interesting is that while the rate of motorised journeys has actually declined from 1 per capita to 0.87, there has been a considerable increase in the share of walking, from 35 per cent to 49.3 per cent in the same period. Buses and minibuses also play a key role in the commuting patterns of Istanbul\u2019s residents, comprising the highest share, 40.8 per cent of all daily motorised journeys. Taken together with shuttle buses operated by private companies to transport employees as well as school buses, they form essential and complementary modes of a successful public transport system. Yet, while the overall share of journeys made by public transport has remained at a stable level of 70 per cent over the last two decades, the increase in the share of private cars from 19.3 per cent to 26.3 per cent has caused serious traffic congestion and environmental pollution.<\/p>\n<p>At the end of June 2009, the Ministry of Transportation announced the location of a third bridge over the Bosporus Strait. This announcement followed the earthquake proofing maintenance work on Fatih Sultan Mehmet Bridge, the second bridge, which exacerbated the city\u2019s already congested traffic patterns. Currently, approximately 420,000 vehicles cross the Bosporus each day on the city\u2019s two existing bridges. The logic of the Government is rather simple. Today the two bridges are clogged. Because the city is growing fast and the number of automobiles is growing much faster, a third, even a fourth and fifth bridge are necessary. But this argument ignores a crucial factor in transport planning \u2013 the \u2018induced traffic\u2019 which results from changes in land use and activity patterns following road construction. Thus, construction justified as a remedy for congestion only creates congestion in its own right. In short, it is impossible to build one\u2019s way out of traffic congestion. Attempts to do so only lead to a continuing cycle of rent-seeking land speculation, lobbying by construction firms, political patronage and a renewed search for \u2018solutions\u2019.<\/p>\n<p>Public opinion about the third bridge is divided. In Tarabya on the European side and Beykoz on the Anatolian side, two districts which the third bridge could pass through, some residents hope the bridge will help develop their neighbourhood. But not everyone shares this optimism. There are also concerns that the natural environment, specifically the forests \u2013 the lungs of the city \u2013 and the water reservoirs in the North, will be severely damaged by the third bridge.<\/p>\n<p>Further evidence of how Istanbul\u2019s transport policies fail to establish a sustainable low-carbon transport system for the city can be found in the controversy surrounding the Ministry of Transportation\u2019s project to create the Bosporus Highway Tube Tunnel. This US$ 1.5 billion two-storey, two-lane, 5.4 kilometre-long tunnel is expected to bring almost 80,000 cars to the historical heart of the city each day. Yet despite calls from transport experts, professional organisations and NGOs, tendering of the project has been completed but neither the tunnel nor the third bridge are included in the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality\u2019s strategic plan for the city.<\/p>\n<p>In Istanbul, urban transport has long been formed by a road-based policy which lacks an overall financial strategy. Instead, major transport projects are developed and funded on an ad hoc basis. This trend to accommodate the increasing number of automobiles through a road network while extending an insufficient rail transit network has put pressure on the financial resources of the city: between 2001 and 2007 alone, the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality spent 14.8 billion TL (US$ 9.9 billion) on transport projects.<\/p>\n<p>Although half of the daily trips are made on foot, cycle lanes and pedestrian pathways have been ignored by policymakers. Part of the reason cycle trips represent only 0.05 per cent of the total trips in Istanbul is because of traffic and air pollution, but cyclists in Istanbul also confront flooded and obstructed cycle paths and a lack of adequate bicycle parking. There are rumours about a masterplan to add 1,004 km of cycle lanes but without a clear timeframe for delivery, implementation is doubtful.<\/p>\n<p>Even so, progress is being made to reduce emissions caused by transport. The motor vehicle industry in Turkey has adopted the Motor Vehicle Technical Regulations of the European Union. And over the last decade, the urban rail transit network has expanded and emissions from road traffic have decreased due to an increasing number of vehicles equipped with catalytic converters using unleaded petrol, and taxis using petroleum gas. Istanbul\u2019s Metrobus, a bus rapid transit, has decreased the emissions from road traffic as well. The system now carries almost 440,000 passengers a day over 40.4 kilometres of bus lanes separated from the motorway at a speed of 40 km\/h. This has reduced in-vehicle travel time by about 50 per cent and increased use of public transport.<\/p>\n<p>Transport greenhouse gas emissions result from a well-known \u2018three-legged stool\u2019: vehicle fuel efficiency, each fuel\u2019s lifecycle \u2013 how long the greenhouse gas emissions remains in the atmosphere \u2013 and how much people drive. Recent studies make it clear that where and how we invest in transport infrastructure make a difference: people drive less in areas with greater transport options and where it\u2019s easier to walk. Transport investments that reduce the demand for travel by car benefit the environment as well as the economy. One of the greatest challenges associated with implementing sustainable strategies relates to the need to pay sufficient attention to long-term impacts. Reducing greenhouse gases and improving air quality are likely to be of greater concern for future generations. Yet given their typical four or five year term of office, it is too easy for policymakers to focus on immediate needs and overlook long-term problems. As a result, governments favour solutions achieved through policy measures which represent the supply-side of transport policy rather than the demand-side measures of regulation, information and pricing. Demand management measures are known to be more cost-effective in reducing congestion than infrastructure provision, but are more difficult to implement. It is now widely accepted that no single type of policy will solve our transport problems. We cannot, for example, build sufficient infrastructure to overcome congestion. Instead, a package of solutions implemented in tandem will be more effective than any on their own: for example, combining public transport improvements with parking controls and congestion charging can substantially reduce private car use. As the service level of public transport system improves, it is necessary to implement policy options such as congestion charging and parking policies to discourage car use in city centres.<\/p>\n<p>The Ministry of Transport and the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality plays a key role in road transport management in Istanbul, yet responsibilities for traffic legislation and its implementation are scattered across more than ten other ministries and authorities. In a study carried out by the First Council of Urban Transport in 2002, 17 local and national authorities were identified to be partially responsible for the planning, investment, operation and management of the city\u2019s transport. This fragmentation makes planning and coordination of activities extremely difficult. Mechanisms for establishing more effective coordination and streamlined decision-making between the ministries would go a long way to improving transport in Istanbul. In order to address issues of regulation, a proposal for new legislation has been prepared to establish one local authority to coordinate transport across Istanbul.<\/p>\n<p>Spatial planning and urban development in the Istanbul Metropolitan area are controlled by a mosaic of decision-making bodies at the supra-national, national, regional and local levels. At the same time, the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality faces overcrowding, immigration, insufficient policy programmes, illegitimacy, and an inefficient control system. But it seems so clear that decisions for major transportation projects are still made in Ankara regardless the master plans prepared in Istanbul.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":"http:\/\/v0.urban-age.net\/publications\/newspapers\/istanbul\/articles\/11_HalukGercek\/en_GB\/11_HalukGercek_en.pdf","article_publishing_date":"November 2009","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"29","name":"Haluk","created":"2011-10-04 13:55:13","modified":"2011-10-04 14:55:13","slug":null,"family_name":"Ger\u00e7ek","title":null,"email_address":null,"photo_legacy":null,"profile_text":"","organization":"","role":"","additional_affiliations":null,"qualifications":null,"staff_pages_blurb":null,"office_location":null,"display_after":null,"display_until":null,"extended_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb_lang2":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation_lang2":null,"phone_number":null}],"attachments":false,"gallery":{"slug":false,"extra_classes":"","slides":[]}},{"request_language":"","current_page_uri":"\/media\/search-dev.json","lang2_slug":false,"lang2_name":false,"parent_publication_id":11,"featured_image_uri":"","article_title":"Istanbul in a Global Context","permalink":"istanbul-in-a-global-context","article_subtitle":"","article_abstract":"<p>\u00c7a\u011flar Keyder maps out the spatial effects of neo-liberal globalisation in Istanbul, marking the relationships between the consolidation of private land, and rising social and spatial inequalities.<\/p>\n","article_summary":"","article_text":"<p><div id=\"attachment_738\" style=\"width: 768px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-738\" title=\"09_00\" src=\"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/11\/09_00.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"758\" height=\"348\" \/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">In a city fuelled by a real-estate development boom, the TOKI tower blocks in Atasehir are transforming the derelict lands near the endless traffic of the TEM highway.<\/p><\/div>\n<p>By the standards of neo-liberal globalisation, Istanbul is a success story. It is a business platform for the transnational corporate elite as well as a playing field for the cosmopolitan consumers of global lifestyles. There are blocks of newly erected high-rise office buildings, luxury residential compounds and towers, dozens of shopping centres offering an exclusive shopping \u2018experience\u2019. The city has been successful in showcasing its unrivalled cultural heritage, attracting a growing number of tourists. Its central areas have been beautified to offer the trimmings of global lifestyles. The gentrification of Beyo\u011flu and the historic peninsula, and the re-building of the waterfront around the Golden Horn have created new spaces of leisure and culture. Luxury hotels and world-class restaurants open every week, occupancy rates are high as international meetings and congresses proliferate, the nightlife and culinary delights are legendary. This is not an entirely skewed picture. Despite complaints from the locals, Istanbul\u2019s entire urban area looks more \u2018finished\u2019 than before: roads are paved, new city parks have multiplied and municipal services function relatively well throughout the city.<\/p>\n<p>This achievement is due in large part to the current structure of the world economy favouring the resurgence of the metropolis. Since the 1980s the control and management functions of global capital shifted to the great cities of the world. Speculative investment surged, making urban real estate development a leading sector. This political economic shift does not explain Istanbul\u2019s performance on its own: the world economy may provide an opportunity but projects of the globalising elite cannot always be implemented. In fact, until the 1990s it looked as if Istanbul would miss the boat. Caught between a political class committed to populist modernisation and a timid bourgeoisie reluctant to alienate Ankara\u2019s bureaucracy, actors in the city were unable to mobilise significant resources for global success. Things changed, however, when the conservative-Islamic AKP (Justice and Development) party \u2013 which won the 1994 local elections thanks to support from rural immigrants in peripheral neighbourhoods \u2013 proved to be surprisingly pro-business. In abandoning traditional populism they started looking for new ways to market the city; their adoption of the neo-liberal discourse found a perfect fit in projects preparing the city for showcase on the global stage.<\/p>\n<p>Istanbul\u2019s accomplishment may in large measure be attributed to the coherence of the urban coalitions\u2019 project to upgrade the city\u2019s image and marketing potential in the eyes of a footloose global demand for investment, culture, or leisure. Since the mid-1990s, Istanbul has been a one-party city \u2013 an unusual continuity given the political instability that characterised the period after 1960. Initially, the election of Tayyip Erdo\u011fan as mayor was considered by the secularist elite in Ankara as an act of rebellion to be punished. This in turn fed into the estrangement between the national capital in the steppes and the imperial city, but the rift was soon mended. Especially after the successful liberalisation of the Turkish economy, it was understood that the city served as the gateway to the country and perhaps to the greater region. And this crucial role could not be jeopardised. Thus the newfound understanding with Ankara facilitated the transition from an informal, unstructured and insufficiently institutionalised globalisation towards a more formal and deliberate platform which invited agents of global networks into the city. Following the political ascendancy of AKP to central government in 2002, the former Mayor of Istanbul (now the Prime Minister) reinforced this strategy to position Istanbul on the global stage.<\/p>\n<p>Official initiatives, such as a series of high-profile international meetings and conferences, were an important dimension of this project. More crucial, however, was the government\u2019s desire to attract global flows to the city since Istanbul\u2019s economic success would endorse claims for their liberal vision. Willing partners, the city\u2019s bourgeoisie benefited from business initiatives and land development, mobilising a newfound interest in philanthropy. Ongoing series of art exhibitions, festivals of film, theatre, jazz, and classical music, on a scale that rivals that of any large European city, have been initiated by non-profit private foundations. Such endeavours have secured the willing cooperation of both the central and city governments: the most recent instance is the selection of Istanbul as 2010 Cultural Capital of Europe, the achievement of yet another public\/private partnership.<\/p>\n<p>Nonetheless, there is one group, the migrants of the last two decades, who have borne the brunt of this newly created wealth, especially because their chances to access self-made housing have all but collapsed. No longer able to build a gecekondu, recent migrants have been relegated to marginality in derelict neighbourhoods. More recently, they have been joined by the displaced population of inner-city squatters targeted by the new \u2018Urban Transformation\u2019 law (Law 5366), which was designed to clean the city by razing unsightly neighbourhoods in core areas. Now, with the global crisis and economic downturn, the trickle down in the form of personal service employment also threatens to dry up. When unskilled jobs are harder to find, and wages that will sustain livelihood are a rarity, poverty becomes more visible. That this depravation coincides with the ethnic and social background of recent migrants \u2013 Kurdish migrants displaced from their villages due to the war, the Roma population of Sulukule threatened by \u2018Urban Transformation\u2019, refugees from African countries \u2013 has led to more than income polarisation and poverty. It has created social, cultural, and spatial exclusion, and perhaps a permanent sub-proletariat.<\/p>\n<p>In a city where more than half the buildings were constructed illegally and where population growth was accommodated through informal production of housing, the end of populism served to announce that land had finally become a commodity. With it came the message that revenue rather than the opportunity to maximise political patronage should underlie policy. As a commodity, land became the favoured object of speculation \u2013 often in huge developments determining the spatial expansion of the city. Public sector infrastructure projects and motorway construction blazed the path, as in the residential and business development around TEM, the Trans-European Motorway. The central government\u2019s Mass Housing Administration (TOKI)participated in this development by creating high-rise residential units for low-income groups in the far peripheries of the city. Roads connecting to the anticipated third bridge over the Bosporus will likely create another axis of expansion North of the city.<\/p>\n<p>For most of its modern history, Istanbul\u2019s spatial momentum has been determined by its population growth. Immigrants had to be accommodated even if their houses were illegal. Municipal services, schools, transport and public parks followed settlements, creating relatively decent, if uninspiring neighbourhoods. Then, as permits were obtained and shacks were turned into brick and mortar apartment buildings, the initial gecekondu housing was consolidated. Finally, some of the occupants could leave the old neighbourhoods and opt for middle-class residential developments. Real estate has always punctuated the stages of social and cultural transformation.<\/p>\n<p>The current crisis, however, exhibits a less benign aspect of this spatial expansion in the form of real estate development fuelled by the global wave of speculative investment. Coalitions formed during the last 15 years facilitated and profited from this development; the financial explosion that accompanied economic growth contributed to it. As a result, Istanbul ended up with an enormous bubble of excess real estate \u2013 office buildings, shopping centres, and middle-class residential developments \u2013 just as occurred in East Asian cities prior to the 1997 financial crisis and the United States in the run up to the 2008 global economic collapse. These new developments broke fresh ground in the perimeter of the settled city, creating an extensive new sprawl with the hope of continued expansion. The bursting of the bubble in the credit market, however, has dashed the dream. There is likely to be a long wait before the existing stock finds utilisation through attrition, upgrading and expansion. The danger is that the cessation of new construction and land development will rob the city of its major motor of growth in terms of absorbing investment and creating employment, leading to an unavoidable period of relative stagnation.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":"http:\/\/v0.urban-age.net\/publications\/newspapers\/istanbul\/articles\/09_CaglarKeyder\/en_GB\/09_CaglarKeyder_en.pdf","article_publishing_date":"November 2009","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"27","name":"\u00c7a\u011flar","created":"2011-10-04 13:45:45","modified":"2012-08-09 11:52:45","slug":"keyder-caglar","family_name":"Keyder","title":"","email_address":"","photo_legacy":"","profile_text":"<p>Professor of Sociology, Binghamton University, State University of New York<\/p>","organization":"","role":"","additional_affiliations":"","qualifications":"","staff_pages_blurb":"","office_location":"","display_after":"","display_until":"","extended_blurb":"","special_2012ec_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb_lang2":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation_lang2":null,"phone_number":null}],"attachments":false,"gallery":{"slug":false,"extra_classes":"","slides":[]}},{"request_language":"","current_page_uri":"\/media\/search-dev.json","lang2_slug":false,"lang2_name":false,"parent_publication_id":11,"featured_image_uri":"","article_title":"Istanbul within a Europe of Cities","permalink":"istanbul-within-a-europe-of-cities","article_subtitle":"","article_abstract":"<p>If Turkey joins the European Union, what would happen to Istanbul?

This proposition is both true and untrue. Just to make the matter more complicated, new membership in the European Union, as in Poland and Hungary, did integrate cities like Warsaw and Budapest into the network of European cities; economic and political integration, however, also stimulated social and cultural withdrawal from Europe.<\/p>\n<p>The background to a Europe of cities lies in how most European cities dealt with the huge damage done in World War II. Recovery meant, largely, restoring the central-city fabric that existed before. New buildings filled in an old grain, one usually established before the Industrial Revolution, which meant in turn that the periphery of cities became the key site for new forces, the thinly populated or un-built periphery the receptor for new immigrants, new forms of industrial production and offices. Profound consequences followed: the human settlements on the periphery became isolated from, and invisible to, those who lived in the centre, while the economic activities at the edge followed a different path from economic renewal in the centre. The seats of national power were restored, following an old European pattern, to the compact city centre \u2013 a matter of re-linking centralised power to the fortunes of the urban centre.<\/p>\n<p>This path of restoration in London, Manchester, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Warsaw, and Milan contrasted with the post-War decades in American cities, whose middle-classes abandoned the central city; again, in a different way, to S\u00e3o Paulo and Johannesburg, places which in the growth years that began half a century ago, developed patchwork enclaves of race and class, cities which became archipelagos of poverty and wealth.<\/p>\n<p>The Urban Age conference in New York addressed the hollowing out of the central city. William H. Whyte first plotted the movement of executive jobs from the city streets to isolated corporate campuses in the 1960s and 1970s, and he explored the worrying tendency of such companies to implode shortly afterwards. Ex-urban locations, he suggested, had the effect of isolating corporations from the face-to-face economy of the city, and thus further weakened companies that were already vulnerable. In Johannesburg, the work of the Urban Age found an equal hollowing out of its urban core. Here the driver was exclusively racial; the economics of large-versus-small business playing a weak role.<\/p>\n<p>These very different ways of evacuating the centre contrast with the European city in the last half century. Rebuilding the distinction between centre and edge, privileging again the centres, marked Europe\u2019s path of urban growth. The image of a \u2018Europe of cities\u2019 concerns the networking of those centres, not of the cities as a whole. Movements of populations from one periphery to another are quite rare: few Turkish families pushed to the edge of Frankfurt are prompted to make a beach-head migration to the edge of London, and there is little movement between the peripheries of London and Paris. All the same time the centres grow ever more tightly bound: the financial trade routes between the City of London and Frankfurt are stronger than, and largely divorced from, the financial activity each city does with its own nation. Similarly, the trade route of foreign tourism \u2013 a principle source of central-city wealth \u2013 is marked by a fixed London-Paris-Rome path rather than by dispersal from the monumental urban centre into the rest of the nation.<\/p>\n<p>These are familiar facts which, however, many working for the European Union hoped to alter. In the 1990s, Brussels\u2019 officials in both the labour sector and in urban planning wanted cities in new member states, particularly Poland and Hungary, to break the post-War pattern of Western European growth. Through investment policy and the application of a common labour-law, Brussels sought to create more internally cohesive cities, less segregated from and more integrated with smaller towns in the same nations. This has not occurred, at least not in financial services, high-tech, and creative industries \u2013 the drivers of the new economy; more integrated into Europe, Warsaw and Budapest are increasingly withdrawn from their nation-states.<\/p>\n<p>Many would argue that global capitalism is the source of centralisation and withdrawal, that this pattern of urban growth can be seen also in Mumbai, Tel Aviv, or S\u00e3o Paulo, that it is not distinctively European. At the Urban Age conference in S\u00e3o Paulo, Saskia Sassen argued that the rebuilding of central areas in cities, whether downtown or at the edges, is part of their new, global economic role. Rebuilding key parts of these cities as platforms for a rapidly growing range of global activities and flows, from economic to cultural and political also explains why architecture, urban design and urban planning have all become more important and visible in the last two decades. And more standardised. Related to this sweeping economic change is the fact that modern urban development has homogenised building forms, the poured-concrete and glass box becoming ubiquitous.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_730\" style=\"width: 742px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-730\" title=\"05_01\" src=\"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/11\/05_01.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"732\" height=\"539\" \/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Streets are places of commercial activity, providing much valued face-to-face contact and autonomous public spaces while keeping the city on a constant move.<\/p><\/div>\n<p>One reason standardisation has progressed lies in the fact that such buildings can be globally traded: like money, they are equally the same in all places. The social consequences of standardisation can also be taken to be global rather than European: homogeneity in built form abets segregation \u2013 that is, it becomes much quicker and easier to erect entire communities destined for particular social groups, to sort people out, than if planning has to adapt to the quirks and complexities of local buildings. This marriage of homogenisation and segregation is an issue Urban Age addressed in Mumbai. If true, then the prospect for Istanbul as a city in the European Union would mean that the machinery of the Union \u2013 its codes of labour and building practice, its banking rules on investment, its assertion of citizen-rights of free movement \u2013 abet the process of inclusion in a capitalist rather than a European order. \u2018Europe\u2019 lays down just a marker of how this larger inclusion will occur through accentuating the distinction between centre and periphery.<\/p>\n<p>But that distinction matters in large measure because it is not static. Exclusion is not a fact that people accept passively. Much of the dirty work of rebuilding and maintaining European cities was done by immigrant labour; immigrants worked on building sites, cleaned the streets, staffed hotels and hospitals. Now, in the second and third generation of these immigrant families, continued existence as peripheral peoples is no longer acceptable. Nor has the concentration\/withdrawal occurring in the centres of cities become naturalised as a fact of life among \u2018native\u2019 Europeans. The resurgence of cultural nationalism in the last decade signals in part a refusal of people outside the centre to be side-lined, their invisibility taken for granted, the local seen as mere decor. The centre\/periphery distinction generates profound social dissonances. This is a large issue, one faced by any city like Istanbul entering a period of expansion.<\/p>\n<p>The dissonances of centralisation appeared in places as diverse as Mexico City and Shanghai in our study of global cities. But a more focused version of this problem might appear in Istanbul because it is a \u2018hinge city\u2019, an urban form which has had a particular shape in Europe. Venice is the European prototype of the hinge city. Renaissance Venice was built on trade with very distant places, dealing in spices from India, slaves from what is now Morocco, cloth and rugs from the countries along the Asian Silk Road, and sending to the East goods finished in Europe. Filled with foreign traders, Venice sought to contain them through the most rigid residential segregation confining Jews to the three ghetto islands, Turks, Germans, and others to fondaci, gated communities in which people were checked out for the day and checked in at night. The fondaci failed as containing institutions: foreigners gradually installed themselves everywhere in the spaces of Venice.<\/p>\n<p>What makes Venice the prototype of a hinge city is the impermanence in time of these foreigners inhabiting a cosmopolitan space. They seldom stayed more than a few years. And this has been largely true of hinge cities around the Mediterranean. We imagine that places like .Izmir, Barcelona, or Casablanca are cities where different groups lived together generation after generation, but the statistical reality is that the internal composition of each community shifted from generation to generation. The Mediterranean hinge city earned its reputation for mutual tolerance only because much of its population used the city as a transit camp, a site for deals and work, by peoples of an entrepreneurial bent who were willing to move whenever they sensed opportunity elsewhere. Mutual ethnic tolerance thus rested on a lack of permanent identification with local life. The hinge city is a city of migrants rather than immigrants, a place of location rather than a destination, a city of mobilities.<\/p>\n<p>Constantinople had, during the era when Venice dominated the Mediterranean, something of this character as well. In the wake of historical research by Fernand Braudel and William H. MacNeil, we now understand better than an earlier generation \u2013 which viewed the Sultanate as a closed society \u2013 just how dynamic the movement of people as well as goods through Constantinople was along the eastern and southern rim of the Mediterranean, even as Europe sought from the sixteenth century onwards to seal the northern rim.<\/p>\n<p>In function, the urban \u2018hinge\u2019 addresses a basic problem in most crossroads cities. This is that the strength of commercial activity attracts more in-migrants than the cities can provide with jobs or opportunities. Rather than rooting misery to one spot, the contacts and information flows which the hinge generates allow people to look and to travel elsewhere. In urbanistic terms, this means that public spaces for sociability acquire great importance: talk in the cafe or in the market is how people find work or opportunity.<\/p>\n<p>It is sometimes thought that the advent of cyberspace communication will replace the physical public spaces of the classic hinge, but economically the case has not been proven. Face-to-face contacts and connections remain vital, because they generate personalised trust in what is being communicated, and such personalised trust is especially necessary for poor people to act on information. Without fat bank accounts or institutions to support them, the knowledge they have to act upon resides largely in how they assess the people who impart it.<\/p>\n<p>If the \u2018informal\u2019 public realm is crucial for survival in the over-crowded, under-resourced crossroads city, a great planning tragedy is occurring today in cities around the Mediterranean. The hinges are, as it were, beginning to rust. Along the northern European rim, informal movement and informal labour are becoming criminalised. In my view, the European Union has wrongly conspired with rather than contested the nationalist impulse to make informality illegal. Along the eastern and southern rims of the Mediterranean, the hinge of mobility is rusting due to issues that more directly concern us as urbanists.<\/p>\n<p>Much of the urban development occurring in Lebanon, Egypt, Algeria and Morocco is eliminating or weakening informal public space. In Beirut, for instance, post civil-war reconstruction has forced small-scale enterprises away from the seafront. In Alexandria, the renovation project around the library is replacing informal places usable by poor people with clean, controlled public space meant mostly for tourists. Some of this erasure and expulsion can be traced to economics, but basic issues of urban design are also involved in the weakening of the informal public realm. Informal public space requires under-determined urban planning, that is, an architecture which allows flexibility of use and admits physical gaps and indeterminate relationships between buildings. It is in these liminal spaces that informality can flourish \u2013 the cafe built into a parking lot or the market stall outside a loading dock. The virtue of informal public space in hinge cities requires us, in other words, to challenge ideas that emphasising spatial order and purpose in urban design, ideas realised in practice, produce an over-determined environment.<\/p>\n<p>Whether this is also a danger in Istanbul is an issue I hope will be raised by the Urban Age. If it is a danger you are facing, we ought to explore what we, as policy-makers, planners, and architects can do to protect and promote informal public space. Both the challenges of centralisation and informalisation could be put as a question: does Istanbul in the future want to look more like modern Frankfurt or Renaissance Venice?<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":"http:\/\/v0.urban-age.net\/publications\/newspapers\/istanbul\/articles\/05_RichardSennett\/en_GB\/05_RichardSennett_en.pdf","article_publishing_date":"November 2009","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"23","name":"Richard","created":"2011-10-04 13:06:04","modified":"2014-04-08 17:47:21","slug":"sennett-richard","family_name":"Sennett","title":"","email_address":"","photo_legacy":"","profile_text":"Richard Sennett is Professor of Sociology, LSE and University Professor of the Humanities, New York University.","organization":"LSE Cities, London School of Economics and Political Science","role":"Chair of the Advisory Board","additional_affiliations":"Professor of Sociology, London School of Economics and Political Sciences\nUniversity Professor of the Humanities, New York University","qualifications":"","staff_pages_blurb":"Richard Sennett is a sociologist and Professor of Sociology at the London School of Economics and Political Sciences, and University Professor of the Humanities at New York University.

This changing mood and orientation in Istanbul is a positive sign for the rest of Turkey, as Istanbul has not only effectively become the country\u2019s leading city, but also a microcosm of Anatolia. Istanbul\u2019s predominantly migrant population comes from all over Anatolia, and they maintain their links and networks with the rest of the country. Thus, if this megalopolis of around 15 million can hold on to its perspective of what might be termed \u2018worldliness\u2019 \u2013 a combination of openness, liberalism, pragmatism, democratic culture, and global embeddedness \u2013 then this momentum would help Turkey become more centrally and deeply engaged with, and implicated in, world affairs. Turkey would finally leave behind the remnants of the inward-looking modality that has hitherto marginalised the country and condemned its people to provincialism and isolation.<\/p>\n<p>Hrant Dink\u2019s murder in early 2007 put the tentative and fragile nature of this new cultural orientation into perspective. The murder of Dink \u2013 an Istanbul-based journalist, writer and civil rights activist of Armenian origin \u2013 by a youth with ultra-nationalist connections in front of the office of the newspaper he edited, demonstrated that if there has been a certain opening up, diversification and reinterpretation of the mental maps of Turkey over the last two decades or so, this has been accompanied by a simultaneous convergence of reactionary positions whose common denominator seems to be precisely the fear of openness. What has surfaced is the precariousness of the culture of openness, now increasingly challenged by the very tensions it has given rise to. Hence, how the public culture of Istanbul develops is central to the position that Turkey will adopt in the global world order. Istanbul\u2019s insistence on the virtues of openness, over and against regressive and nationalistic calls for defensive closure, will make all the difference.<\/p>\n<p>Istanbul\u2019s pull into the force field of globalisation is affecting deeply-rooted ways of thinking and acting. With its new spaces and cultures of consumerism, its expanding and deepening financial flows in the real estate and service industries, and its new mechanisms for the global integration of local cultures through commodification, globalisation is making irreversible entries into the daily life of the city, forcing change in urban spaces and on public culture. But it is far from clear how this process of globalisation might translate into an orientation towards worldliness in the city\u2019s public cultural life. As the city opens itself up to the contemporary global order, the issue confronting Istanbul is not the choice between openness and closure, but a choice about the kinds of openness it will admit. Crucial to this debate is the city\u2019s potential to articulate a counterweight to fundamentalist neo-liberalism by enhancing a democratic modality of worldliness. In the face of the uncompromising forces of urban globalisation now assaulting Istanbul, openness could be diminished to the status of a market-driven and market-shaped culture of self-interest. In this context, Istanbul\u2019s choice should be for a kind of openness that deepens democratisation through empowerment of the excluded and the disadvantaged. What is not known is whether the elements for this culture of worldliness to be elaborated are present or emerging, or do not yet exist, in globalising Istanbul.<\/p>\n<p>Istanbul, in fact, has thrown itself open to a new round of urban globalisation. When the Directorate of Privatisation Administration sold 100,000 square metres of National Highways Authority land in Zincirlikuyu to a Turkish business group for US$ 800 million in 2007, the price of land in this central business area increased substantially. Shortly thereafter, the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality finalised the bidding process for a 46,000 square metre warehouse space belonging to the Istanbul Transport Authority, situated immediately adjacent to the Highway Authority\u2019s land. It was sold to a Dubai-based real estate company for US$ 705 million, with future plans to build the Istanbul \u2018Dubai Towers\u2019, Istanbul\u2019s tallest building, at an estimated cost of US$ 5 billion now on hold. With this municipal sale, the value of property in the area rose to US$ 15,000 per square metre \u2013 surpassing average values in the central business districts of London and Tokyo. What was shocking was the speed with which the price of land almost doubled between these two sales, indicating the appetite of global real estate investors for sites in Istanbul.<\/p>\n<p>And there is plenty of land. The transfer of land to global commercial interests is no longer limited to one particular area of the city, as was the case in the mid-1980s. Public spaces located around the city are coming up, one by one, for large-scale privatisation and development initiatives. Public authorities and municipalities are not wasting any time to facilitate the sale of public land. Massive stretches of land around both the Galataport and Haydarpa\u015fa zones, situated at the two key entrance ports from the Anatolian and European sides of the Bosporus, are now being considered for redevelopment. Considering that there is also the political will to support privatisation \u2013 Prime Minister Erdo\u011fan recently declared that his duty is to market his country \u2013 Istanbul is going to witness more and more global capital pouring into its beleaguered urban space.<\/p>\n<p>Thus the new round of globalisation in Istanbul is primarily real estate driven. As \u00c7a\u011flar Keyder has remarked, \u2018land has finally become a commodity\u2019. It is within this context that the recent political initiative to push through large-scale urban regeneration programmes targeting neighbourhoods with low-quality housing or derelict but historically valuable properties should be evaluated. Policymakers at both the local and central levels are now frantically drawing up metropolitan-scale visions and plans to put in place the infrastructure required for the next round of investments. Cash-strapped municipal authorities are finding solutions through large-scale projects undertaken by powerful investment and construction companies.<\/p>\n<p>The head of TOK\u0130, the Prime Ministry\u2019s Housing Development Administration, declared that half of \u0130stanbul\u2019s housing stock (approximately 3 million buildings) would have to be replaced over the next 20 years; work would begin in 20 slum-housing areas. Istanbul\u2019s residents \u2013 whether in Sulukule or in S\u00fcleymaniye within the historic centre\u2019s city walls, in Tarlaba\u015f\u0131 in the Pera district or Zeytinburnu to the West of the city \u2013 are now subject to municipal programmes involving the expropriation of private properties in return for cash compensation or relocation to new developments in the far periphery. Thus, the historic Tarlaba\u015f\u0131 district in Beyo\u011flu, with its abandoned Greek Orthodox churches and its streets of dilapidated nineteenth-century houses \u2013 now occupied by Kurdish populations from the South-East of Turkey living side by side with local gypsy populations and illegal African immigrants \u2013 is targeted for clean up. This will entail turning the houses into \u2018attractive\u2019 residences with parking spaces and shopping areas; fa\u00e7ades being one of the few remnants to be retained of the area\u2019s unique character. Across the city, construction companies are soon set to start pulling down entire neighbourhoods. This work is carried out in abeyance of an explicit regeneration and redevelopment agenda to turn city spaces into money-making assets: sites to accommodate the demands of the city\u2019s newly expanding wealth or for tourism, for heritage, shopping, entertainment and large-scale events.<\/p>\n<p>In this new round of globalisation, global investments invade the most profitable areas, ones that are no longer associated with the industrial profile of the city. Investors are attracted to the skyrocketing consumer demand for high-quality housing, recreational and retail facilities, and not surprisingly, for cultural tourism. One by one, industrialised areas are being transformed; as stated by metropolitan mayor, Kadir Topba\u015f, \u2018Istanbul should shed its industrial profile&#8230; Istanbul should, from now on, become a financial centre, a cultural centre, and a congress tourism centre.\u2019 Results of this shift can already be seen in a 550 hectares (5.5 km2) large redevelopment project, master planned by Zaha Hadid, and designated for an industrial area in the Kartal district along the Marmara shore on the Anatolian side, that hosts more than 100 factories. As part of the project, the former Mayor of Kartal had announced plans to attract US$ 5 billion from foreign investors to develop a yacht marina accommodating 1,000 boats, plus hotels, residences and plazas. In response, some 26 industrial landowners with factories in Kartal have started to move their production base, getting ready to turn their much sought-after land into shopping and recreational centres.<\/p>\n<p>The project of globalising Istanbul initiated in the mid-1980s is now being fully realised. But this is a new round of urban globalisation. In the 1980s and throughout the 1990s, the global vision achieved partial and piecemeal results. This earlier phase was distinguished by real estate developments (shopping centres, residential complexes and commercial headquarters), which did not touch most of the city, nor did they have a large impact on the daily lives of its citizens. Instead, they remained sequestered projects of the city\u2019s globalising elite, driven mainly by the Turkish-origin conglomerate capital. Istanbul thus entered the new millennium as a dual city. Now every part of the city is exposed to radical change as more and more land is pulled into the market sphere, catapulting the whole of Istanbul into an irreversible process of large-scale urban development. It is an overwhelming and all-encompassing transformation owing to the alliance of national and local political will as well as economic interests, but it is also happening because of the scale and scope with which global capital has entered the city.<\/p>\n<p>This new round of urban globalisation is not driven by real estate alone. It is also a cultural project. As public spaces fall one by one within the ambit of design and management projects (invariably extensions of global property development companies), the city\u2019s public space has become a business proposition conceptualised in terms of consumption and recreation. The Kanyon shopping centre, recently opened in Istanbul\u2019s central business district of Maslak, illustrates how public space has been incorporated into the culture of hyper-consumption. In as much as it covers a nearly 38,000 square metres plot of land, the centre literally transforms a huge public space into an affluent middle-class consumption arena; and it is not just a mere shopping experience. Four floors wrap around a canyon-like open-air environment to evoke the sense of being in a street lined with upmarket retail outlets, well-groomed street vendors selling traditional food from designer carts, and arty street-lighting and furniture. The publicity material boasts, however, that most walking areas are covered and climate controlled with natural light and open air allowing visitors to enjoy every season without suffering its excesses. What Kanyon offers, then, is a new interpretation and a new culture of the experience of the city and its variety of streets.<\/p>\n<p>In similar fashion, local authorities are initiating large-scale programmes using culture as a vehicle to regenerate city quarters. The Beyo\u011flu Municipality was the first to allow private developers to turn an entire street in a run-down part of the old Pera district into a themed street, based on the French lifestyle. Changing the name of the street from Algeria Street to French Street, everything, from street furniture, sculptures and wall paintings to the design of the restaurant interiors, was styled to evoke a certain image of Montmartre. The street, once a public space, is now a commercial area managed by a business association dictating the outdoor music, the architectural features, and advertising. At one point, there was even an attempt to install security guards at the entrance to the street in order to monitor the flow of \u2018customers\u2019.<\/p>\n<p>New urban regeneration projects and residential developments all come with a cultural approach to urban living. Culture is used to promote lifestyle. According to the marketing concept for one massive residential development project on the Anatolian side of Istanbul, My World Ata\u015fehir, the new urban culture is informed by a dream of a world perfectly and completely thought through: here \u2018you will find the life you are looking for\u2019. Residents live happily within their own self-contained environments, with their own kind of people, without having to rub shoulders with others (even the next-door neighbours); they need only to leave their enclaves for work, and on weekends to travel downtown for a bit of heritage or arts.<\/p>\n<p>In Istanbul, culture and its various signifiers are shifting: in its anthropological sense as a way of life, in its economic sense as a business opportunity, and in its symbolic sense as a seat of power and status. Investing in art and culture has become the fashion of the day, and major business conglomerates and their foundations are competing with one another for suitable spaces to build arts and cultural centres. After the opening of Istanbul Modern, founded by the Eczac\u0131ba\u015f\u0131 family, one of the city\u2019s prominent business families, came the recent announcement from the Suna and \u0130nan K\u0131ra\u00e7 Foundation to turn the centrally located T\u00dcYAP area \u2013 owned by the metropolitan municipality \u2013 into an international centre for culture and arts with a US$ 160 million cultural complex designed by Frank Gehry funded by the K\u0131ra\u00e7 Foundation\u2019s US$ 500 million for arts and culture. For the first time, foreign involvement in the traditionally closed off arts and culture sector is occurring through joint venture agreements and collaborations; a five-year agreement for artistic and scientific cooperation between the Sabanc\u0131 Museum and the Louvre will bring cultural capital in the form of exhibitions, know-how and networking to Istanbul.<\/p>\n<p>Culture is implicated in everything now. Companies use culture to enhance their image as sponsor, but investment in arts and culture also brings with it a higher profile and stature \u2013 elements which in turn help to boost a city\u2019s overall appearance to investors, visitors and residents alike. The central government as well as the local municipalities are now undertaking huge cultural infrastructure projects. In the centre of the city, the Atat\u00fcrk Cultural Centre (AKM) in Taksim and the Muhsin Ertu\u011frul Theatre Hall in Harbiye both illustrate the trend of targeting existing cultural facilities for demolition in order to build super-modern, prestigious and multi-functional cultural spaces. In the case of AKM, however, redevelopment will take place instead of demolition, owing to the public outcry about the building\u2019s secular and republican symbolism.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_742\" style=\"width: 769px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-742\" title=\"12_01\" src=\"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/11\/12_01.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"759\" height=\"409\" \/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Kanyon is one of Istanbul\u2019s first mixed-use design complexes, offering a quasi-outdoor shopping experience.<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Central and local authorities of the AKP have instigated a number of key initiatives \u2013 for example, the Istanbul 2010 European Cultural Capital project \u2013 explicitly aimed at using Istanbul\u2019s cultural assets and resources to improve the global image of the city (and thereby the country). The Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality\u2019s recently completed masterplan makes a great deal of its competitiveness by investing in culture to project a contemporary image of the city. Concepts about \u2018city branding\u2019 and \u2018image marketing\u2019 have thus entered into the city\u2019s political vocabulary. Neo-liberal strategists use culture as a tool for revenue generation as well as tourism \u2013 approximately 30 million visitors to Istanbul are anticipated in 2010. Although initiated by the private sector, this cultural renaissance maintains the support from the government in the form of legal and regulatory changes, including a controversial new law for the \u2018renewal\u2019 of historic areas (Law 5366), in addition to well-financed programmes for the development and promotion of the city\u2019s cultural and tourism infrastructure. Central government has committed an investment equivalent to the Ministry of Culture and Tourism\u2019s annual budget towards the restoration and regeneration of the city\u2019s rich cultural heritage as part of the Istanbul 2010 programme. Istanbul\u2019s bid to become a global \u2018open city\u2019 involves transforming its image, creating what Mayor Kadir Topba\u015f refers to as \u2018a city with a different attitude towards the world.\u2019<\/p>\n<p>As featured in The New York Times, Istanbul is enjoying a renaissance. Regarded as one of the most dynamic cities in the world, Istanbul is open to change, and, indeed, is changing fast. And not only that. In 2005 Newsweek magazine featured \u2018Cool Istanbul: Europe\u2019s Hippest City\u2019. The picture on the front cover displayed a scene of a scantily dressed young man and woman dancing to dimmed red lights in a nightclub \u2013 a westernised lifestyle, not like the old and what may be regarded orientalist depictions of Istanbul with whirling dervishes or squatter areas. So what has changed in Istanbul? The answer lies in the shift away from an inward-looking stance that has taken place: globalisation is forcing open the city\u2019s urban spaces and cultural practices, bringing with it a parallel process of cultural change.<\/p>\n<p>The city is finally relinquishing the feeling of isolation and provincialism that characterised Istanbul\u2019s public culture up to the late 1980s, and even into the 1990s. As business conglomerates compete with one another about larger investments in museums, art collections, galleries and exhibitions, the old model of centrally controlled cultural provision is becoming obsolete. State-run cultural organisations, such as the State Painting and Sculpture Museum or the Atat\u00fcrk Cultural Centre in Istanbul, are now having difficulties maintaining their place within the new cultural scene \u2013 difficulties attracting both audiences and sponsors, and management and financial difficulties as a consequence of being state-controlled. Sponsorship for commercially funded events such as the Istanbul Biennale now commands a company\u2019s status and image, hence Istanbul\u2019s Biennale is flourishing and has now become one of the key artistic events in Europe. The private sector\u2019s reliance on transnational connections with international art institutions helps make the old, closed and inward-looking modality in cultural provision a thing of the past.<\/p>\n<p>This turn towards greater openness and interconnectedness, however, is ultimately an outcome of the city\u2019s gentrification. The \u2018projected city\u2019 is a collection of gentrified spaces, and the cultural imaginary is increasingly being shaped by this project of gentrification. What is significant is the relentless ascendancy of this imaginary. Behind it we find a previously unanticipated coalition of urban elites. This coalition involves what Orhan Esen calls the \u2018North-Istanbul elites\u2019 (the post-1980s generation of secular, middle-class and professional workers) and the rising commercial elites of the Islamic-oriented traditional circles, politically represented by the \u2018innovative group\u2019 in the ruling AKP. Until now, these two elite groups had remained polarised. They now share a common aspiration and a vision of Istanbul as a globalised and gentrified city with orderly and clean public spaces and residential quarters, and an attractive public image with world-class services and goods. Cultural liberation thus responds to expectations of higher living standards.<\/p>\n<p>What I have described so far is the global opening up of Istanbul according to an unfolding and relentless neo-liberal dynamic. In so far as the ruling AKP government have helped open up Istanbul to market-driven global forces, the city\u2019s transformation has been a state-led project. This restructuring of the city suits the aspirations of its globalising elites and an expanding base of property owners. Considering that 58 per cent of the households (out of around 2.5 million from the 2000 census) live in their own property, a considerable proportion of the urban population is directly implicated in the changing economy of the city. What is more, according to the Istanbul Governor\u2019s office quite a significant proportion of this property-owning category consists of those living in recently legalised squatter settlements, or gecekondu. In other words, as the squatters of yesterday turn into property owners of today \u2013 however unplanned and rundown their properties might be \u2013 the scale of market activity is extended.<\/p>\n<p>This process brings together very different constituencies with diverse lifestyles, values, beliefs and practices. It represents a coalition of self-interests involving Islamic communities, secular elites, large capital, small and conservative business interests, and so-called bourgeois bohemians. All these different groups can, in different ways and combinations, join forces \u2013 awkwardly, and ironically \u2013 in their jostle to benefit from Istanbul\u2019s transformation. It is this broad social, cultural and class basis of globalising Istanbul that balances the calls for closure. Nevertheless, this programme of openness hangs in delicate balance in Istanbul, as discourse feeding on nationalism and anti-European sentiments increasingly finds a receptive audience. One reason behind this is the exclusionary mechanisms that globalisation has set in motion. In Sulukule, for instance, one of the oldest Roma neighbourhoods, almost all of the 620 households have been evicted from their properties, with all the tenants relocating to far-flung destinations, despite the fact that they have been residents in this area for generations. This has been because of a municipality-led renewal project, proposing to turn the neighbourhood into an upmarket housing area. The same fate awaits the local Roma population and the recent Kurdish immigrants from the South-East of Turkey in the Tarlaba\u015f\u0131 district. These residents are very poor, but more significantly, without title to their land they are unable to take part in Istanbul\u2019s increasingly market-oriented housing economy. It seems that those lacking title will be quietly relegated to the status of the invisible, no longer heard in the public sphere, except when they become junkies, dealers, or criminalised youth.<\/p>\n<p>Insufficient welfare state structures alongside the collapse of informal and identity-based incorporation mechanisms in the city have created exclusionary dynamics that operate on a much larger scale than ever before. With high levels of unemployment, an unqualified labour force and the continuing influx of immigrants from the rural areas of Turkey, as well as from neighbouring countries and Africa, social exclusion finds fertile ground in Istanbul. The scale of the social problem becomes clear when considering that Istanbul\u2019s official population increased from around 10 million in 2000 to over 12 million in 2007. Almost all of this growth can be attributed to new migration. Even so, Istanbul lacks a social vision to engage the mounting exclusionary dynamics of market-based relations. Unchecked, they may eventually find expression in social fracturing, division and conflict. In a context where the division between the excluded and the included is sharpening dramatically, and where the familiar mechanisms of incorporation are increasingly being weakened, religious and ethnically-informed identity positions can become ready ciphers for frustration and anger. This new round of urban globalisation is characterised, moreover, by the sheer scale and power of global capitalist dynamics to undermine small-scale and individual efforts of urban constituencies hoping to determine the basic conditions of their everyday lives.<\/p>\n<p>Before this neo-liberal programme turns into a grim scenario where powerlessness feeds a backlash of political conservatism and authoritarianism, there is clearly a need for a new politics of openness \u2013 a new perspective based on the notion that \u2018a different global model is possible\u2019. Above all, this is a project requiring a prolonged process of negotiation, with an explicit agenda about the kind of globalisation and openness that might enlarge public spaces of interaction, engagement, and mutual responsibility \u2013 against the grain of the fragmentation and commercialisation of city spaces, which only serve to underscore growing social inequality and exclusion. Is this all just a dream? Will Istanbul come to terms with the choices it faces? In a context where the commissioning of internationally renowned architects for public projects faces mounting anger, with protestors posing the issue as a confrontation between local (read Turkish) versus the international (read outsider), the vulnerability of the neo-liberal project of openness becomes clear. The \u2018old order\u2019 may be dismantling on the ground, where traditional and non-formal structures are no longer able to act as incorporating mechanisms, but it is clearly not being written off entirely. Defensive and fearful responses to urban globalisation slip easily and seamlessly into an exclusionary language and rejection of difference and diversity. Ultimately this may fuel nationalistic fanaticism. The challenge is to deepen and secure the continuation of public experiences of worldliness \u2013 to not lose sight of the real choice that Istanbul needs to make.

Its usage denotes a bottom-up, spontaneous action, especially prevalent during the first wave of mass-migration, to provide mass housing under conditions in which conventional or government-initiated models of housing supply failed.<\/p>\n<p>In Istanbul, this act of land-taking was by no means legal, but was nonetheless sanctioned as it allowed the government to pass the costs and political hurdles of urbanisation on to the migrants themselves. In doing so, businesses were able to disregard housing expenses when calculating labour costs and politicians could tie votes to the provision of land alone. This arrangement was accepted as long as these newcomers provided for their own welfare; and by growing food in their own courtyards and walking to jobs in nearby industrial factories, these newcomers were able to reduce the costs of urban living.<\/p>\n<p>All was made possible by the availability of publicly owned lots on what was then the urban periphery. Residents of the\u00a0<em>gecekondus<\/em>\u00a0were spared the full-scale expropriation and economic expulsion that commonly occurs during periods of intense urbanisation. Instead, they became urban without being forced to change too much, occupying a self-built garden town that was both rural and urban. The names of the original <em>gecekondu<\/em>\u00a0settlements frequently ended with\u00a0<em>tepe<\/em>, meaning \u2018hill\u2019, to denote their location on the steep slopes of the valleys surrounding the city\u2019s new industrial zones. The emergence of\u00a0<em>gecekondus<\/em>\u00a0followed industrial developments alongside four main axes: the Golden Horn, the primary location for industrial activity along the waterfront and its adjacent river valleys; the historical northern ridge of the Buyukdere; and two arteries to the West (the E5 motorway historically known as the London Road) and to the East (the Ankara motorway) both of which also serve some older industrial settlements behind the Marmara coast. As transport shifted away from the coasts to road networks, the older Bosporus industrial settlements also attracted\u00a0<em>gecekondus<\/em>, although much more moderately.<\/p>\n<p>Residents organised their communities and their own economic networks: the construction, transport and distribution of consumer goods, and sometimes even the infrastructure needed for water and electricity supply for their households. Demolitions and conflicts with authorities were not unusual but when demolition did occur, new homes were frequently reconstructed on nearby land, with former lots taken over by migrant groups backed by more influential political actors.<\/p>\n<p>In the early 1960s,\u00a0<em>gecekondu<\/em>\u00a0settlements became an officially accepted solution to housing the majority of new migrants. From then onwards, Istanbul experienced a unique socio-political climate, which temporarily diminished the initial scepticism among the middle classes about the\u00a0<em>gecekondus<\/em>. This wave of sympathy and identification continued beyond the events of June 1970 when Istanbul became occupied by the industrial working class. Thus after World War II, residents of the\u00a0<em>gecekondus<\/em>\u00a0found they could convert their inherent rural poverty into comparative wealth within the space of one generation. At a time when the city\u2019s population was close to 4 million, originally barren settlements had already become blossoming garden cities. However, large-scale urbanisation in the 1980s and 1990s almost totally displaced such manifestations of the golden age of informal urbanisation, which is remembered by some older Istanbulites as the \u2018innocent\u2019 period of migration. As a consequence the\u00a0<em>gecekondu<\/em>\u00a0vanished as abruptly as it appeared on the stage of Istanbul\u2019s history.<\/p>\n<p>It is the \u2018neo-liberal revolution\u2019, which began in the mid-1980s, that has made Istanbul what it is today: a post-<em>gecekondu<\/em>\u00a0city whereby developers convert households in the former\u00a0<em>gecekondus<\/em>\u00a0to middle-class standards. A socio-economic heterogeneity now defines this post-gecekondu condition and has helped original migrants improve their economic status. After the 1999 earthquake, a \u2018top-down neo-liberalism\u2019 agenda emerged which expropriated the property obtained through informality, and downgraded development rights obtained through informal urbanisation to a second-class status. This has resulted in the empowerment of new large-scale developers and actors dominating the production of urban areas.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":"","article_publishing_date":"November 2009","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"31","name":"Orhan","created":"2011-10-04 14:00:29","modified":"2011-10-04 15:00:29","slug":null,"family_name":"Esen","title":null,"email_address":null,"photo_legacy":null,"profile_text":"","organization":"","role":"","additional_affiliations":null,"qualifications":null,"staff_pages_blurb":null,"office_location":null,"display_after":null,"display_until":null,"extended_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb_lang2":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation_lang2":null,"phone_number":null}],"attachments":false,"gallery":{"slug":false,"extra_classes":"","slides":[]}},{"request_language":"","current_page_uri":"\/media\/search-dev.json","lang2_slug":false,"lang2_name":false,"parent_publication_id":11,"featured_image_uri":"","article_title":"Istanbul's Spatial Dynamics","permalink":"istanbuls-spatial-dynamics","article_subtitle":"","article_abstract":"<p>Kees Christiaanse, Mark Michaeli and Tim Rieniets describe Istanbul\u2019s evolving urban form and the proliferation of gated communities.<\/p>\n","article_summary":"","article_text":"<p><div id=\"attachment_746\" style=\"width: 769px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-746\" title=\"16_00\" src=\"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/11\/16_00.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"759\" height=\"355\" \/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Suburban gated communities became a reality in Istanbul in the 1990s, increasingly rubbing against gecekondus and village-like neighbourhoods.<\/p><\/div>\n<p>About 15 years ago, it was still possible to enjoy the bustling urbanity stemming from the mixtures of people, neighbourhoods and activities in Istanbul. Then, the flair of ancient Constantinople\u2019s rich cultural diversity and proximity to the Asian continent was abundant. Today these characteristics are threatened by a wave of technology and modernisation. On the one hand this shows the emancipation and economic prosperity Turkey has achieved, but it has also introduced global structural challenges regarding mobility, urban renewal, social stratification and sprawl, as well as spatial and functional segregation at an unprecedented scale.<\/p>\n<p>Over the past few decades, for example, an explosion of car ownership resulting from Istanbul\u2019s new prosperity has put severe pressure on the city\u2019s road system and has increased air pollution. This has happened at the same time as investments in public transport have lagged. Although the city introduced a new underground train running East to West along the coast under the Bosporus, as well as a Bus Rapid Transit line (BRT) along the urban motorways, traffic congestion is expected to reach paralysing levels over the next few years. This will no doubt cause considerable economic damage since traffic congestion hinders the flow of people, goods and information. And scale is certainly an issue. At times Istanbul\u2019s congestion problem seems to be almost as bad as that of S\u00e3o Paulo or Jakarta. In today\u2019s emerging modern society cars continue to be status symbols. Equipped with air-conditioning, a telephone and sophisticated computers, driving a car is like riding in a comfortable spaceship of clean air surrounded by a toxic universe outside. In Istanbul, the desire to own a car is further exacerbated by the sprawl of urban development extending beyond the Bosporus \u2013 with villages turned into larger suburbs, commuting times are rising rapidly.<\/p>\n<p>The Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality has acknowledged that a proper system of public transport constitutes, like in every city, the only solution to counter this massive threat to mobility. At the same time, they have planned motorways, widened roads and introduced new traffic lanes that could create further divisions and destroy the city\u2019s delicate and subtle neighbourhood structure. In response to complaints about the inaccessibility for emergency vehicles, the imminent collapse of buildings by earthquakes and the poor housing conditions of older developments, new neighbourhoods consisting of large super blocks with high-rise apartment towers, green spaces and parking facilities are being planned to substitute the existing ones. As a result, old, finely-meshed street patterns of the Gecekondu and yap-sat districts, with their intricate social and micro-economic structures, their vibrant street activities and their small-scale character, are being replaced by anonymous housing projects that could be anywhere in the world. The resulting functional segregation does not allow for small-scale economic improvisation and investment, one of the lifelines of Istanbul\u2019s poor. What is worse, large numbers of the city\u2019s diverse population are forced to travel considerable distances for even basic needs, further compromising mobility on all levels.<\/p>\n<p>Gated communities emerged in Turkey in the 1980s, and have become the most important project of urban transformation and expansion in the city. Driven by an increasingly powerful real estate market, the phenomenon is tolerated by politics and planning, and is widely accepted by the public. This process is not only changing urban and architectural patterns in the city; equally important \u2013 but less understood \u2013 are the implications on the social and economic structures at the neighbourhood level.<\/p>\n<p>G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk, a former agricultural village surrounded by state-owned forest and military sites in the North-West of Istanbul, represents a pioneer of this mode of development. In the 1990s real estate developers discovered the area\u2019s potential for high-end housing developments. Since then, more than 30 gated communities have been constructed in close proximity. This has resulted in a population increase from 1,500 in 1993 to approximately 20,000 in 2008, as well as higher land prices. But it has also dissected G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk into fragments: what was once a village has been turned into an island among islands. And yet, although segregation seems to be the dominant pattern of G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk\u2019s urban trajectory, integration is also taking place. A thin but indispensable network of economic, social and cultural encounters connects G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk\u2019s seemingly separated fragments into an integrated economic whole. Outnumbered, the remaining villagers now benefit from opportunities in the gated community\u2019s emerging service sector. They are employed as gardeners, housekeepers or nannies, and enjoy regular access to the everyday life of an elite otherwise behind closed walls. This economic boom, it would seem, has allowed individual benefits to overshadow the negative consequences of segregation.<\/p>\n<p>A growing awareness about the scarcity of Istanbul\u2019s natural resources, however, has sparked criticism about the unsustainable character of suburban developments such as G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk. In response, new planning guidelines are restricting the proliferation of gated communities on the outskirts of the city. At the same time, enormous regeneration projects in the inner city are making way for new large-scale developments in Istanbul\u2019s historic centre. The recently adapted Law 5366, aimed at ensuring the sustained use and protection of deteriorated historical and cultural monuments and structures through their renewal and reuse, will allow for the vast expropriation and replacement of illegally constructed and inhabited buildings in Istanbul. In late 2007 the Turkish Daily News named 48 areas declared as regeneration projects in the city, a scale involving the demolition of 1 million buildings and repairs on another 200,000. Thus, instead of building exclusive urban exclaves on the city\u2019s outskirts, an increasing number will be built inside the city: islands for upper-class housing, modern office space and commercial enterprises.<\/p>\n<p>Despite this trend, the traditionally small-scale entrepreneurial spirit and structure of Istanbul offers an alternative in the form of street guilds and bazaars specialising in particular types of goods. This concentration of goods brings with it a competition among sellers to differentiate themselves and their products; competitors concentrated together thus creates an orientation towards the public spaces \u2013 and greater visibility \u2013 in front of the buildings, pushing commercial activity onto the sidewalks and into the city\u2019s street. This spatial condition emphasises mobility of people and goods and leads to a series of casual exchanges whereby the built structures accommodating these exchanges serve solely as a conduit for economic processes.<\/p>\n<p>This contrasts to shopping centres and gated communities, which represent an entirely different concept of the city and the goods and experiences it produces. Precisely tailored to the specific needs of a limited user group, each contradicts the uncertainties, ambiguities and openness that define urban life. As secluded islands they orient themselves in opposition to the small-scale entrepreneurial structure. Turning the spatial code of the city inside out, instead of maximising coherence and permeability within a specific urban enclave, shopping centres and gated communities minimise points of intersection and operate in isolation. Chance encounters and the unexpected are substituted by organised events at a distinct destination. Instead of the buzz of urban life generated by active street fronts, the focus is on convenience and composed interior spaces. The result is urban space based on concepts of idleness and exclusion instead of integration into the dynamics of the city and its economy.<\/p>\n<p>Istanbul, like any global city, cannot deny those who prefer to remove themselves from the urban economy through segregation; doing so would only curtail the flow of required investment in redevelopment and urban change. The negative consequence is thus unavoidable, even if it seems obvious: while isolated islands use investment capital from the city to hide themselves in ever-more grandiose stage-set-like pieces of architecture, the city fades into the background, and the real urban complexity dwindles.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":"http:\/\/v0.urban-age.net\/publications\/newspapers\/istanbul\/articles\/16_Christiaanse%2bMichaeli%2bRieniets\/en_GB\/16_Christiaanse%2bMichaeli%2bRieniets_en.pdf","article_publishing_date":"November 2009","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"35","name":"Kees","created":"2011-10-04 14:08:50","modified":"2011-10-04 15:08:50","slug":null,"family_name":"Christiaanse","title":null,"email_address":null,"photo_legacy":null,"profile_text":"","organization":"","role":"","additional_affiliations":null,"qualifications":null,"staff_pages_blurb":null,"office_location":null,"display_after":null,"display_until":null,"extended_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb_lang2":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation_lang2":null,"phone_number":null},{"id":"36","name":"Mark","created":"2011-10-04 14:25:14","modified":"2011-10-04 15:25:14","slug":null,"family_name":"Michaeli","title":null,"email_address":null,"photo_legacy":null,"profile_text":"","organization":"","role":"","additional_affiliations":null,"qualifications":null,"staff_pages_blurb":null,"office_location":null,"display_after":null,"display_until":null,"extended_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb_lang2":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation_lang2":null,"phone_number":null},{"id":"37","name":"Tim","created":"2011-10-04 14:25:33","modified":"2011-10-04 15:25:33","slug":null,"family_name":"Rieniets","title":null,"email_address":null,"photo_legacy":null,"profile_text":"","organization":"","role":"","additional_affiliations":null,"qualifications":null,"staff_pages_blurb":null,"office_location":null,"display_after":null,"display_until":null,"extended_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb_lang2":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation_lang2":null,"phone_number":null}],"attachments":false,"gallery":{"slug":false,"extra_classes":"","slides":[]}},{"request_language":"","current_page_uri":"\/media\/search-dev.json","lang2_slug":false,"lang2_name":false,"parent_publication_id":11,"featured_image_uri":"","article_title":"It's Istanbul (Not Globalisation)","permalink":"its-istanbul-not-globalisation","article_subtitle":"","article_abstract":"<p>Hashim Sarkis offers an overview of the political, cultural and economic complexities underlying the changing relationship between Istanbul and the greater region.<\/p>\n","article_summary":"","article_text":"<p><div id=\"attachment_731\" style=\"width: 1156px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-731\" title=\"06_00\" src=\"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/11\/06_00.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1146\" height=\"550\" \/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Tahtakale, a neighbourhood with some of the best preserved urban grain, hosts dynamic commercial activity with goods coming from near and far.<\/p><\/div>\n<p>In July 2008, I could not find a seat on a plane from Beirut to Istanbul. Fearing that I would miss my appointment with Mayor Topba\u015f, I asked a travel agent to find me alternative routes via Damascus or Amman. She laughed and explained that tourists were flocking to Istanbul from all over the Arab world because of Noor, a highly popular Turkish soap opera, dubbed in Syrian Arabic dialect and broadcast across the Arab world via a Saudi satellite network. Travel agencies were organising guided tours to the villa and to the different neighbourhoods where the series was shot. Some 100,000 Saudis visited Istanbul in 2008, up from 30,000 the year before. Their itinerary included the city\u2019s historic monuments, but the Byzantine churches and Ottoman palaces were not the main attraction. The Arab public may have finally rediscovered the capital of an empire that controlled the region for over 500 years, only their focus has been diverted.<\/p>\n<p>The \u2018Noormania\u2019 of 2008 represented more than a fleeting infatuation. The attraction was to the blissful rendition of Istanbul, to a higher level of social tolerance within Islam, to the glitz of a city with 35 billionaires, and to the cosmopolitan lifestyle of a young couple living beyond the confines of their traditional values. Whereas the soap operas of Hollywood, Brazil, and Mexico have already disseminated their own portrayals of glamour and passion to Arab satellite televisions, observers of the \u2018Noor\u2019 phenomenon contend that the Turkish soap opera unfolds too close to home to be dismissed. The love between a young Muslim couple, a woman\u2019s career drive supported by her husband, and the possibility of moving from a village in Anatolia to a villa on the Bosporus within the span of one life time captivated about 80 million Arab viewers in the last episode. This also unleashed a negative, visceral reaction from religious leaders who wanted to ban the show.<\/p>\n<p>While social scientists debate the gender, class, and ethnicity impact of the Istanbul-based soap opera on the Arab world, the spatial and geographic terms of this relationship may be worth exploring as well. How could it be possible that Istanbul\u2019s pull has not been felt in the Arab world until now, given the physical proximity, the historic connections, and the large overlap between the Arab and Turkish traditions, cuisines, music, and languages?<\/p>\n<p>From Hollywood, the answer would be \u2018What is the difference?\u2019 A video clip of the famous tune \u2018Istanbul not Constantinople\u2019, rendered by the Tiny Tunes animators, conflates stereotypes of Istanbul with those of the Arab world. Deserts and tents form the backdrop of the city\u2019s minarets and domes. Lumping everything East of the Marathon planes together, however, is not a new mistake in American popular culture. Orientalist prejudices notwithstanding, cultural similarities are to be expected where there are geographic proximities. In this case, the recent Arab attraction to Istanbul may have more to do with the city\u2019s ability to shun off such affinities; it is these evolving geographic relationships which help to explain Istanbul\u2019s cosmopolitan profile.<\/p>\n<p>The dynamics underlying Istanbul\u2019s exponential growth in the past 20 years have been consistently ascribed to the advent of globalisation. Whether describing the financial and gold markets, the textile and fashion industries, or the construction and real estate enterprises, the city\u2019s reach is increasingly beyond the immediate geography of Turkey and the confines of a national territory \u2013 Istanbul\u2019s economic influence stretches to a second ring of regional, geographic proximities in Central Asia and the Balkans, and also to the world. As is the case with many global cities, Istanbul\u2019s economic activities are rooted geographically and historically. For example, the construction industry\u2019s link to Central Asia is based on geographic proximity but also on affinities with reawakened Turkic cultures in former Soviet nations. In globalisation discourse, however, emphasis is placed on transcending these connections and attaining a role, scale and scope that situate the city somewhere outside its immediate geography. In this respect, Istanbul dutifully obliges. As the capital of an empire that ruled over an extended territory, Istanbul illustrates the continuities between empire and global city through its current relationship with its first (national) and second (regional) territorial rings.<\/p>\n<p>In this transition from geographic confines to a regional and then global role, it is significant to recognise which geographies have been suppressed. Istanbul\u2019s connections to the Balkans, Central Asia, and Western Europe have all fuelled its ascent to a global city. European standards (and aspirations) guide its transport, infrastructure, and environmental standards. Its urban work force is increasingly Balkan. Yet its location in the Eastern Mediterranean region has largely been ignored. Thus until recently, it would seem that connections to and within the Middle East remain confined to the geopolitical space of the Cold War era. Certainly tensions in the Eastern Mediterranean between Greeks and Turks, Arabs and Israelis, Turks and Armenians, Cypriots and Cypriots, Turks and Arabs, Arabs and Arabs, etc. have hindered free trade and stronger cultural connections between Turkey and the Arab world. Lebanon, for example, has always had good trade relations with Turkey, but until recently prejudices against the Ottoman past and the strong cultural and political presence of Greek Orthodox and Armenian communities have prevented this connection from manifesting a more conspicuous cultural exchange.<\/p>\n<p>Throughout the period of Ottoman rule between 1516 and 1918, Istanbul exerted varying degrees of influence on cities in the Arab world. The models most frequently used to describe this influence are the triad of cities (Istanbul, Cairo and Aleppo) in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and the network of ports (Istanbul, Izmir, Haifa, Beirut, Thessaloniki and Alexandria) in the nineteenth century. In both models, Istanbul held primacy as a distant first, but was never obsessed with its centrality. In the early-sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the relationship between the imperial centre and its provinces tightened compared to the earlier Ottoman nomadic-state apparatus that maintained strategic distance as a means of exercising power. Even when Istanbul controlled the administrative organisation and institutional buildings in sixteenth-century Aleppo, the structure of waqf organisation, or religious holding of land, tended to reflect local practices and elite rule. In the nineteenth century, the discreet train lines connecting the network of ports to Turkey\u2019s agricultural hinterlands further reinforced this loose relation between centre and periphery as the train system failed to create a network within the hinterlands. Ethnic groups, merchants and bazaars traded heavily with each other across the Mediterranean in an exchange of goods and ideas, but they held on to their respective hinterlands with loose reins.<\/p>\n<p>A structural shift in the spatial organisation of the Ottoman Empire occurred in the late nineteenth century, particularly after its loss of the Balkans, when Istanbul sought to impose a more centralising presence in the Arab provinces. This translated into heavy investment in agricultural and irrigation reforms, new road networks, and the introduction of railroads, tramways, and waterworks into the major cities of the Eastern Mediterranean. Many of these projects were financed through private concessions to European companies, reflecting each countries\u2019 growing interest in the region. Still, the image of the city-empire prevailed over these equalisation efforts. The clock towers and fountains planted in the centres of many Levantine cities have been interpreted as signs of modernisation, while the establishment of decentralised networks of trains and public spaces were seen as signs of the ubiquitous image of the centre, the Sultan of Istanbul. Despite these large investments aimed at equalising the regional territories through modernisation, the disparities between Istanbul and the Eastern Mediterranean remained vast until 1918 when the Ottomans finally withdrew from the region.<\/p>\n<p>The subsequent creation of Arab nation-states, complete with their own exclusionary identities and prejudices, exaggerated their severance from the Ottoman past, and not only because the Arab states equated this past with the Turkish present. The perceived contradiction between Arab nationalism and the rise of Turkish nationalism further widened this cultural rift. Despite recent joint efforts between the governments of some Arab countries and Turkey to revise the history books, this past continues to be portrayed as a long, dark era. A second point of divergence surrounded Turkey\u2019s decision to join the Baghdad Pact\u2019s sphere of American influence in the 1950s, while Egypt led the Arab world towards a non-aligned position.<\/p>\n<p>Between the World Wars, Istanbul lost both its ethnic populations to the nascent nation-states around it as well as its political primacy to Ankara. In 1927, the year of the first national census, Istanbul had a population of 690,000 whereas Turkey counted 13 million. That same year, Cairo, the second city of the Ottoman Empire, reached one million and superseded Istanbul. Cairo would continue to rise as the regional political and demographic centre. The independence of the Arab countries after World War II led to a period of rapid urbanisation around their capital cities: Beirut, Baghdad, Kuwait, Amman, and Abu Dhabi all witnessed exponential growth during this period while achieving primacy within their own national territories. Riyadh would have to wait until the mid-1970s to surpass the port city of Jeddah; only Damascus would remain rivalled in its demographic and economic primacy by the regional capital of Aleppo.<\/p>\n<p>When Istanbul again regained its prominence as the centre of industry and trade in Turkey, particularly during the liberalisation period under Prime Minister Adnan Menderes between 1950 and 1960, it set itself on a different path of growth and development than the Arab capitals. Before other cities in the region were feeling the effects of rapid urbanisation, Istanbul was challenged by the need to erect motorways to link its expanding metropolis, the growing \u2018misery belts\u2019 on its periphery, and the stagnation of its inner city. It also went through the processes of urban renewal and building of edge city centres earlier than the others. The historic preservation movement in Istanbul also achieved immense powers in the 1980s, leading to its being listed as a World Heritage site by UNESCO in 1985. Significantly, this came six years after Cairo and Damascus gained a similar status, but the scope and depth of preservation policies in Istanbul far exceed that of either. Istanbul has managed to curtail the growth of its informal sector more successfully than other metropolitan centres in the area. Amman, Beirut, Damascus, and even some of the wealthier cities like Jeddah, continue to struggle with the presence of large informal sectors. In 1996, as much as 75 per cent of Cairo\u2019s residents lived in informal housing.<\/p>\n<p>Despite the growing rift, the Arab world and Turkey shared some of the planning and design formulas circulated by the Bretton Woods development agencies, the United Nations, and individual experts. For example, in 1938 the French planner Henri Prost, who worked in North Africa on the plans of Fez and Casablanca, is credited with the consolidation of Istanbul\u2019s depopulated areas and the introduction of industry inside the city. Similarly, the Swiss architect-planner Ernst Egli, who worked between Ankara and Beirut throughout the 1930s and 1950s, proposed administrative reforms corresponding to the new metropolitan order of these cities.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps one of the main commonalities between Istanbul and the wider region is in the urban administration of cities with mayors and cities with walis (governors), a challenging and conflicting system that sometimes leads to bizarre reporting structures and to delayed decision making. Since 1984, however, Istanbul has managed to create a metropolitan municipality with an elected and relatively powerful roster of mayors to lead the city. Since then, the city has undertaken urban improvements, including those to increase control over informal development, which could be attributed to a strengthened local government. This is in contrast to most of the Arab cities, where central administrations continue to exercise relatively strong control over the budgetary and administrative responsibilities of their mayors, many of whom continue to be appointed, not elected.<\/p>\n<p>The 1970s marked a significant overture between Turkey and the Arab world: blocked out of the European market, Turkish workers migrated to the Arabian Gulf. Today some 100,000 Turkish workers live in the Middle East, around 95,000 of them in Saudi Arabia, and the numbers continue to grow as Turkish engineers and construction companies move to the Gulf.<\/p>\n<p>The twenty-first century rapprochement between Turkey and the Arab world, which has culminated in the \u2018Noormania\u2019 of 2008, is often attributed to the political ascendency of Turkey&#8217;s Islamic AKP (Justice and Development Party). Interestingly, this is seen both as a gesture towards the Islamic world in defiance of continued snubbing by Europe, as well as an expansion of regional markets and economic powers that are strengthening Turkey\u2019s bid for membership in the European Union. A clear indicator of such improved relationships is trade. Exchange between Turkey and the Arab world increased from US$ 11 billion in 2002 to US$ 62 billion in 2008. In 2005, a Turkish Arab Economic Forum was established with Istanbul as its permanent base, and in 2006 Turkey was invited to become a permanent guest in the Arab League. Since 2002 Arabs have invested about US$ 30 billion into Turkey, mostly in Istanbul. Beyond trade, political rapprochement has accelerated during the past eight years and Turkey has graduated from nervous neighbour to trusted mediator and peace keeper between Arabs and Israelis. Talks to share electricity and water via under-sea conduits between Turkey and Israel and Turkey and the Arab World have taken this new cooperation to a futuristic level.<\/p>\n<p>It is in this recent period that a particular Turkish brand of large-scale real estate development and project management and construction merged with a finance and development brand from the Gulf. These brands have created a network of exchanges and an unusual margin of excess in the development of these cities. The United Arab Emirates has tried to build towers that bear its name over the precious skyline of the Bosporus. The British-Iraqi architect Zaha Hadid is designing the new district of Kartal on the southern Asian tip of the city. Most of these projects are private developments sponsored and supported by the city\u2019s government. Timothy Mitchell suggests a similar phenomenon of excessive iconic mega-projects in Cairo where projects such as the 1990s \u2018Dreamland\u2019 operate beyond the sphere of governmental fiscal restraints and grow instead from the sale of cheap public land to generate a real estate market and finance public expenditure on infrastructure.<\/p>\n<p>The gentrification and rebuilding of historic centres in Riyadh, Beirut, Aleppo, and now Jeddah and Doha, has reinvigorated interest in Ottoman architectural heritage, but not without transliterations and occasional misinterpretations. The developers of downtown Beirut preserved very few of the Ottoman era buildings but they countered with an overblown Ottomanesque revival style, including a new mega-mosque that dominates the downtown skyline. The restoration of Aleppo fared much better in preserving the Ottoman urban fabric and monuments by linking them to an economic revitalisation project. The destruction of an Ottoman fortress in Mecca in 2002 by Saudi authorities to pave the way for a housing project only serves as a reminder of the deep ideological tensions that remain between the two countries.<\/p>\n<p>The rage against Noor by religious leaders was the latest expression of these tensions and may have led to the collapse of a new niche of tourism in Istanbul. And yet moderation finally prevailed: the flights to Istanbul continued to be full.<\/p>\n<p>I finally found a flight to Istanbul. I met with the Mayor in his summer offices on the Malta Kiosk in the Y\u0131ld\u0131z Palace gardens, where a member of his foreign relations staff addressed me in perfect Arabic. He and other staff members had studied Arabic in Jordan at the University of Zarqa as part of an exchange programme. The mayor does not speak English, but used his English translator in order to speak to me, an Arab professor from the United States, while I spoke in Arabic to his foreign relations staff.<\/p>\n<p>From the Y\u0131ld\u0131z Palace gardens, the seat of power in the nineteenth century, endless panoramas open up in front of your eyes, and you can see across the Bosporus deep into the interiors of the city. Some of these interiors resemble edge cities and gated communities to be found elsewhere in the world, including Dubai, Beirut, Cairo, and Riyadh; so far, they have not overwhelmed this city\u2019s unique beauty and its ability to seduce. No city in the world exhibits as much face as Istanbul. The expanse and extent of visibility weave a world of their own, inviting and forbidding at the same time.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"<p>Text written in memory of Wissam Ezzeddine.<\/p>\n","pdf_uri":"http:\/\/v0.urban-age.net\/publications\/newspapers\/istanbul\/articles\/06_HashimSarkis\/en_GB\/","article_publishing_date":"November 2009","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"24","name":"Hashim","created":"2011-10-04 13:33:01","modified":"2011-10-04 14:33:01","slug":null,"family_name":"Sarkis","title":null,"email_address":null,"photo_legacy":null,"profile_text":"","organization":"","role":"","additional_affiliations":null,"qualifications":null,"staff_pages_blurb":null,"office_location":null,"display_after":null,"display_until":null,"extended_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb_lang2":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation_lang2":null,"phone_number":null}],"attachments":false,"gallery":{"slug":false,"extra_classes":"","slides":[]}},{"request_language":"","current_page_uri":"\/media\/search-dev.json","lang2_slug":false,"lang2_name":false,"parent_publication_id":3,"featured_image_uri":"","article_title":"Johannesburg: Housing and Neighbourhoods","permalink":"johannesburg-housing-and-neighbourhoods","article_subtitle":null,"article_abstract":"","article_summary":"","article_text":"<h1>HOUSING JOHANNESBURG<\/h1>\n<p>Johannesburg, home of wealthy and poor, permanent and temporary residents, reveals extreme models of housing and urban neighbourhoods. From enormous mansions with vast landscaped gardens in tree lined avenues, to dense shack settlements accessed by muddy paths. From highrise, high density blocks in the inner city, to low rise suburban sprawl, and the medium density cluster developments transforming the semi rural periphery.<\/p>\n<p>The road to democracy was fought on the basis of human rights but despite the removal of discriminatory legislation, low income housing developments have since 1994 entrenched the fragmentation and segregation of the apartheid city.New RDP (Reconstruction and Development Programme) housing has perpetuated the patterns of apartheid planning, providing low density, 27m2 houses in monotonous suburban layouts that continue to locate the poorest furthest from the benefits of urbanity.Whilst wealthy and middle income households have exercised choices about residential neighbourhoods, poor (mostly black) households have remained in the designated low income townships of the apartheid plan. Ironically these once despised townships are transforming into lively urban neighbourhoods where residents themselves have taken the initiative to consolidate and invest in their environment. Demonstrating enormous creativity, the streets are teeming with people, informal trading, children playing and many opportunities for chance encounters with neighbours.<\/p>\n<p>Despite the impressive delivery of 1.7 million houses since 1994, the housing backlog and demand for new housing is increasing due to: natural population growth; continuing in-migration; urbanised households tending towards smaller families; extended family structures; and an increase in child-headed households as a result of the HIV\/AIDS pandemic. Housing provision focussed on the delivery of houses rather than other forms of tenure and types of accommodation. This is borne out by the increasing demand for rental apartments provided both by private sector and social housing institutions.High demand for rental rooms with shared ablutions and cooking facilities is evident in the fact that the single sex hostels, developed for migrant workers, continue to be extremely overcrowded with four to eight persons sharing a room. Although most of these hostels can hardly be described as desirable accommodation, for many it is the only affordable alternative. The government\u2019s policy on hostels has been to convert them into family accommodation but this has proved difficult and very expensive. Many hostel conversion projects have met with resistance as this would result in dedensification and displacement of existing residents and simultaneously render the new units unaffordable. The demand for rooms, often occupied by families, is also evident in the increasing provision of rooms and shacks in the backyards of township houses. These rooms built by homeowner landlords have provided a substantial proportion of rental accommodation utilising the township house or RDP house as an income generating resource. For many poor people who are unemployed, or rely on temporary employment, or who operate in the informal sector, these rooms are the only affordable accommodation available.Rural to urban migrant workers are still prevalent, and for many it still makes more economic sense to work in the city and send remittances to the rural areas, than to bring a family to the city.<\/p>\n<p>Inner city accommodation in highrise apartment blocks is perceived to be predominantly the domain of immigrants from other African countries, although many local people have also chosen to locate there to gain access to employment opportunities and benefit from amenities.Apartments are sublet to make them more affordable and often several households share one apartment. This has resulted in extensive deterioration of the build-ings as overcrowding puts a strain on services and a lack of management and maintenance aggravates the situation. There have been some successful regeneration initiatives by private property companies and social housing institutions that have turned neglected buildings into desirable accommodation. However, the high costs of management and maintenance make these \u2018successful\u2019 projects unaffordable to low income earners.These poorer residents are driven to cheaper accommodation in abandoned buildings run by \u2018slumlords\u2019who subdivide the building into rabbit warrens of rooms with inadequate ablution facilities. The city managers often find themselves in the invidious position of being criticised when they evict people from these unhealthy and overcrowded living conditions, and equally condemned, if residents die as a result of fires in these unsafe buildings. Social housing projects subsidised by the government and intended for lower income households are proving expensive to build and to manage.These projects are not affordable to the poor and are only serving the very upper end of the subsidised income band. Recent social housing developments are only providing 20-30% of the units for subsidised rental in order to make the projects viable.<\/p>\n<p>During apartheid the form and growth of the city was determined by the public sector utilising the Group Areas Act and modernist theories of planned neighbourhoods. Currently, the power of the city planning department appears to have diminished despite extensive processes to produce Local Integrated Development Plans.Whilst, government provided low income housing continues within the neighbourhood planning paradigm, new residential living environments on the periphery of the formerly white areas are being promoted by private developers. Their sole objective seems to be profit driven as they buy up land in an ad hoc manner with little concern for the creation of urban environments that have a life beyond the next development. This part of the city no longer consists of an integrated network of streets and neighbourhoods but rather a set of arterial roads giving access to a proliferation of cluster developments enclosed by high walls and security fences. Private developers trade on the reputation of Joburg as the crime capital to sell these safe and secure gated communities. Entry and exit occurs via private car with little chance of neighbourly encounters outside of the gated community. The only pedestrian activity in the road is that of domestic workers walking to the nearest taxi stop.<\/p>\n<p>Johannesburg\u2019s urban living environment thus continues to be spatially fragmented and socially segregated.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":null,"article_publishing_date":"July 2006","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"100","name":"Lone","created":"2011-11-01 14:27:36","modified":"2011-11-01 14:27:36","slug":null,"family_name":"Poulsen","title":null,"email_address":null,"photo_legacy":null,"profile_text":null,"organization":null,"role":null,"additional_affiliations":null,"qualifications":null,"staff_pages_blurb":null,"office_location":null,"display_after":null,"display_until":null,"extended_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb_lang2":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation_lang2":null,"phone_number":null}],"attachments":false,"gallery":{"slug":false,"extra_classes":"","slides":[]}},{"request_language":"","current_page_uri":"\/media\/search-dev.json","lang2_slug":false,"lang2_name":false,"parent_publication_id":3,"featured_image_uri":"","article_title":"Johannesburg: Labour Market and Work Places","permalink":"johannesburg-labour-market-and-work-places","article_subtitle":null,"article_abstract":"","article_summary":"","article_text":"<h1>AN UNLIKELY GLOBAL CITY<\/h1>\n<p>Johannesburg is historically a mining centre and an industrial city, but today its economy is that of a financial and business services centre \u2013 these sectors make up almost a third of gross geographic product (GGP). With commerce accounting for a fifth of GGP, the fast changing industrial economy contributes less than a sixth.<\/p>\n<p>Johannesburg\u2019s GGP was estimated at US$15.5 billion in 2002. This 16.4% of gross national product contrasts sharply with the city\u2019s 7.2% share of national population.With the surrounding urban region the city contributes well over a third of GNP.Over the last decade the annual growth rate has been rising from about 2% per annum towards 6% today. But employment growth has averaged only 1% per annum while unemployment rose between 1996 and 2001 from 27% to 37%. Johannesburg has high population growth compared not only with New York and London, but with Mexico City and Shanghai. Despite the booming times, the challenge of jobs looms ever larger.Beyond the city are hundreds of thousands of rural households dependent upon it \u2013 observe the long-distance \u2018taxis\u2019 ceaselessly conveying the supporters and the material support of those housesholds out of and back into the city.<\/p>\n<p>Like Shanghai, Johannesburg has been restricted in its past growth by a policy of urban containment, in this case racially motivated. Whilst the city has grown enormously since the 1950s, it has clearly not done so to the extent of creating a mega city on the scale ofMexico City or Shanghai.However the entire \u2018continuous polycentric urban region\u2019 of Gauteng province, to which Johannesburg is central, (and which includes Tshwane (Pretoria) to the north and Ekurhuleni to the east), has a population likely to exceed 15 million within 15 years, and is indeed in the process of becoming a \u2018mega-urban region\u2019 equivalent to some of the larger world cities. Can it build the economy and opportunity to match?<\/p>\n<p>There is an enormous concentration of business in Johannesburg.There are approximately 290,000 formal sector business enterprises which employ about 950,000 people. Some 74% of national corporate head offices are in the city, using much of the approximately 7 million square metres of office space available. This in turn represents 55% of the total office space in the country. Previously concentrated in the city centre, office space is now spreading out across many growing suburban nodes.Among the companies based in Johannesburg are most South African and international banks operating in the country. Approximately 70% of banks have their headquarter here \u2013 mostly located in the centre. There are 580 accountancy firms. The JSE Securities Exchange is eleven times larger than the next largest exchange in Africa.At the end of 2002 it ranked 20th in the world, measured by market capitalisation of shares of domestic companies, being roughly equivalent in size to those ofMumbai, S\u00e3o Paolo, Singapore and Helsinki.<\/p>\n<p>From the first, Johannesburg has been a site of international organisations, particularly corporations, and media. The city is the key point of global economic contact for South Africa and a much wider region \u2013 a role hugely expanded since 1990. In turn it is Johannesburg based companies which increasingly shape business in many other African cities from Bamako to Dar es Salaam, in sectors such as telecommunications, retailing and banking.<\/p>\n<p>Like most other cities of the global south a large part of the local economy is generally thought of as \u2018informal\u2019 in Johannesburg. The informal sector is growing very rapidly \u2013 it accounts for something like a sixth of all \u2018jobs\u2019. This of course is a low proportion by the standards of many African cities, but there is no sign of the proportion decreasing.A key challenge for the future is to find the means of raising productivity and income levels in the informal economy towards those of the formal economy, perhaps through enhancing the integration of the sometimes separate worlds.<\/p>\n<p>The connection between local and global business and broader society is particularly striking in Johannesburg.But that connection involves directly, only a minority \u2013 symbolised by the mingling of business tourists and high income residents in the expensive shopping centres in the northern suburbs.Yet there are other forms of connection with economies (and social life) in other parts of the world. Patterns of movement link Johannesburg with much of the rest of the African continent. For example, traders from Mali sell wares in Johannesburg market places and purchase commodities here to take to markets in west Africa.<\/p>\n<p>\u2018Black economic empowerment\u2019 is a highly significant feature, advancing the interests of a powerful emerging black \u00e9lite. New intersections between business and government abound. The face of economic power is likely to be very different within a decade, but that does not resolve the burning challenges of the economy, jobs, and the economic geography of the city and its region.<\/p>\n<p>According to Bernstein and McCarthy, Johannesburg is the most global city in Africa but an \u2018increasingly unlikely member of a global network of world cities\u2019. The city government recognises at least some of the difficulties and has, in its major economic development policy, Joburg 2030, identified two key social issues to be addressed if the city is to provide a space for serious levels of investment and economic growth. Those issues are skills, and crime.Neither is fully within the range of powers formally available to the city government.Add to these the fact that the sprawling nature of the built environment has long attracted criticism for its low densities and apparent inefficiencies. Yet the spatial organisation of the city and its surroundings somehow seem peculiarly suited to particular patterns of accumulation: taxis make money moving people from townships and shack areas to glossy malls and office complexes; extensive freeways provide for rapid movement of commodities between far flung industrial zones, commercial spaces, households and indeed far off ports and markets.<\/p>\n<p>It is not at all clear what \u2018sustainable\u2019 would mean in this context. Yet in the vibrancy of activity across these complex spaces, must lie the answer to the challenge of work for all otherwise the city will dash the hopes of more than its present generation.<\/p>\n<p><em><br \/><\/em><\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":null,"article_publishing_date":"July 2006","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"97","name":"Alan","created":"2011-11-01 14:17:31","modified":"2011-11-01 14:17:31","slug":null,"family_name":"Mabin","title":null,"email_address":null,"photo_legacy":null,"profile_text":null,"organization":null,"role":null,"additional_affiliations":null,"qualifications":null,"staff_pages_blurb":null,"office_location":null,"display_after":null,"display_until":null,"extended_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb_lang2":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation_lang2":null,"phone_number":null}],"attachments":false,"gallery":{"slug":false,"extra_classes":"","slides":[]}},{"request_language":"","current_page_uri":"\/media\/search-dev.json","lang2_slug":false,"lang2_name":false,"parent_publication_id":3,"featured_image_uri":"","article_title":"Johannesburg: Mobility and Transport","permalink":"johannesburg-mobility-and-transport","article_subtitle":null,"article_abstract":"","article_summary":"","article_text":"<h1>TRANSPORT AS JUSTICE<\/h1>\n<p>City Johannesburg \/ This way I salute you\u2026\u201d, the poet Mongane Wally Serote wrote in a celebrated 1970s poem.

On the one hand, they are sprawling realities with density levels too low for sustainable public transport. This encourages further sprawl and growing car dependence. On the other hand, there is high density in the populous townships and informal settlements on the peripheries of our cities. In the apartheid era, these townships were deliberately surrounded by highspeed freeways and rail-lines, like mediaeval moats but with the opposite intent \u2013 to protect what lay without.<\/p>\n<p>Marginalisation and containment, planned under apartheid, has often been unintentionally perpetuated in the postapartheid period. For instance, two million low-cost houses have been rolled out nationally since 1994.But to meet this ambitious target, the bulk of the housing has been located on peripheral land.Access and mobility inequities have been deepened.<\/p>\n<p>This unwitting entrenchment of some of the apartheid spatial legacy has not been helped by neglect of public transport, or by a series of well-intended but inappropriate policies, tangled institutional arrangements and unsustainable interventions. The consequences are dramatically visible in our cities, not least Johannesburg.<\/p>\n<p>While only 37% of households in Johannesburg own a car, private car use to get to work has now surpassed other modes.On the other hand, the percentage of \u2018stranded\u2019 people in the city who walk to work (often in dangerous circumstances) for more than 30 minutes, because they cannot afford any form of public transport whatsoever, has increased. Another staggering 46% of households in Johannesburg are spending more than 10% of their poverty-level incomes on transport.<\/p>\n<p>Significant numbers of the poor in Johannesburg (as in our other cities) find themselves marginalised to the distant peripheries of the city where there are few jobs and few amenities. They are hostage to unsafe walking or costly and unreliable public transport.<\/p>\n<p>Recent Johannesburg household surveys find very high levels of dissatisfaction with public transport. Fare prices, crime on board and at terminuses and stations, taxi violence, and the danger of accidents, particularly in minibuses, are all listed as very serious concerns by around half of households.<\/p>\n<p>The persisting legacy of apartheid infrastructure also impacts dramatically on the lives of Johannesburg residents. In 2003 there were 1,076 transport-related deaths in the city, 42.1% of these being pedestrians. Among children younger than 15 years, pedestrian fatality is the leading cause of unnatural death.<\/p>\n<p>How can the metropolitan authorities in Johannesburg begin to create a safer and spatially more equitable city? Unfortunately, for the moment, there are many challenges and constraints. Johannesburg authorities have little direct leverage over the public funding directed towards the main public transport modes in the city.Metrorail is a national public entity receiving R2.1 billion (US$0.29 billion) as an operational subsidy.But the subdivision of this subsidy is decided upon nationally, as if the various city-based commuter rail systems were part of some national network.<\/p>\n<p>Bus subsidies of R2.4 billion (US$0.33 billion) are handled by provinces.Again, Johannesburg has little leverage over any of this subsidy. It even finds its own municipal bus company competing on unfavourable terms with the provincially subsidised, privately owned PUTCO.<\/p>\n<p>Minibus taxis, the major public transport mode in the city, receive no operating subsidy. The national government has been endeavouring to implement a stop\u2013start R7 billion (US$1 billion) taxi recapitalisation programme for the past six years, however, it has been largely disconnected from any metrolevel transport planning.<\/p>\n<p>To complicate matters further, the Gauteng provincial government is about to construct a R20 billion (US$2.7 billion) rapid rail project. In the face of considerable public opposition, there are now attempts to retro-fit greater integration into this Gautrain project. But, in terms of route and its privileged and paltry target ridership, it remains essentially a costly, stand-alone project that will do little to transform the mobility inequities of Johannesburg and the province.<\/p>\n<p>Our public transport policies call for an integrated,multi-modal approach.They also call for appropriate devolution to municipalities, where such integration is most likely to be achieved.While there is some progress, our interventions have tended to be uni-modal, un-devolved and institutionally scattered.<\/p>\n<p>For all these reasons, the heartless,\u2018thick iron breath\u2019of Jo\u2019burg City continues daily to suck in and spit out millions of its inhabitants.<\/p>\n<p><em><br \/><\/em><\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":null,"article_publishing_date":"July 2006","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"98","name":"Jeremy","created":"2011-11-01 14:20:03","modified":"2011-11-01 14:20:03","slug":null,"family_name":"Cronin","title":null,"email_address":null,"photo_legacy":null,"profile_text":null,"organization":null,"role":null,"additional_affiliations":null,"qualifications":null,"staff_pages_blurb":null,"office_location":null,"display_after":null,"display_until":null,"extended_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb_lang2":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation_lang2":null,"phone_number":null}],"attachments":false,"gallery":{"slug":false,"extra_classes":"","slides":[]}},{"request_language":"","current_page_uri":"\/media\/search-dev.json","lang2_slug":false,"lang2_name":false,"parent_publication_id":3,"featured_image_uri":"","article_title":"Johannesburg: Overview","permalink":"johannesburg-overview","article_subtitle":null,"article_abstract":"","article_summary":"","article_text":"<h1>THE VIEW FROM OUTSIDE<\/h1>\n<p>Like Melbourne or San Francisco born a generation or two before, Johannesburg is a city that erupted into existence out of a spasm of explosive growth. In all three cities, rapid urbanisation was triggered by the rush to exploit the discovery of large deposits of gold. Like Melbourne, Johannesburg became an instant metropolis toward the end of the 19th century, crystallising from a mining camp into a city of stone and stucco. It imported electric trams and trolley buses, dance halls and department stores in a matter of decades. Of course, Johannesburg had more gold, and therefore more need of rather more mining labour than the other two cities. It attracted the ambitious and the dispossessed from around the world: Russian Jews fleeing persecution; indentured Chinese labourers (65,000 of them were shipped in and then out again when they were considered surplus to requirements); Indians moved in from Natal; and also Africans, pass laws permitting.<\/p>\n<p>Unlike Melbourne and San Francisco, Johannesburg grew up on the edge of the gold fields.And, in contrast to its coastal counterparts, it is a mile above sea level. Johannesburg has lost the trams that still grace Melbourne and San Francisco. They have been replaced by swarms of micro-buses that put the city closer to Mexico City or Moscow in ethos. The surviving public transport system is regarded with such anxiety by Johannesburg\u2019s citizens that nobody who can afford a car would even consider using public transport.But its shared roots with its American and Australian counterparts are still recognisable. That is perhaps, what makes it a subject of such fascination to those who observe the evolution of cities from the relative comfort of western Europe.<\/p>\n<p>Johannesburg is the product of a set of circumstances that are highly specific to Africa. It was born out of the conflict between Afrikanerdom and a British empire engaged in its final bout of expansionism. It was shaped by the cruel restrictions of the apartheid regime, as well as by the dreams of modernity of the post-war years, that together brought about some distinctive inversions of urban norms.But it is also a kind of laboratory for projecting urban phenomena to their extremes.<\/p>\n<p>The apartheid regime deliberately planned for low density in black areas, as an instrument of social control. Soweto for example was built on the model of an English Garden City, its density increased only through multiple occupancy.Higher densities were reserved for the more affluent whites in the inner ring, living in Brazilian inspired highrises.Now the city has become a honey pot for a new kind of Africa, drawing inmigrants, legal and otherwise, from all over the continent. The whites have consolidated in the northern suburbs.<\/p>\n<p>In fact the pre- and post-apartheid city does not represent an entirely sharp a break as it might seem.There was a gradual relaxation of the racial controls on black urban settlement before majority rule, and the patterns of change have their echoes of other cities. It is a city that forms part of a complex urban hierarchy which reflects South Africa\u2019s origins as the union of a range of once individual states, a country with its parliament in Cape Town, the executive based in Pretoria, which is now close to the edge of the Johannesburg conurbation, and a supreme court in Bloemfontein.<\/p>\n<p>Johannesburg grew rapidly as a commercial, banking city, an upstart challenger which quickly overtook the older,more genteel Cape Town.To some, the city is in itself a mark of colonialism, in an Africa of nomadic movement. Certainly it attempted to exclude black people from citizenship for half a century. One reflection of South Africa\u2019s postapartheid constitutional settlement is the way in which Johannesburg has constantly drawn and redrawn its political boundaries during the last decade.This has allowed it to incorporate suburbs with an ease that Los Angeles would certainly envy. It has also seen local boundaries within the city reshaped, initially along radial lines so as to ensure an income and racial balance within each unit. These boundaries have now been superseded with an entirely different structure. Soweto itself was included into the city boundaries only four years ago.<\/p>\n<p>Johannesburg is a city of around three million,with the infrastructure and the skyscrapers of the first world, and with a degree of hollowing out, and suburban flight which can be found to match that in any American city.But the process has been given an accelerated twist by an epidemic of violent crime and by the rapid changes brought about by the creation of a black managerial class since the ANC came to power. The starkest symbolic move in this process of hollowing out was the departure of the stock exchange for the white northern suburbs. The last four star hotel in the city centre closed four years ago.<\/p>\n<p>Johannesburg is a city in which the malls and gated communities which we associate with Southern California have been given their most baroque \u2013 perhaps one should say Tuscan \u2013 expression, in deference to the style of choice of the developers.They have turned the northern edge city of Sandton into an alternative to the city centre that has been abandoned by all but the most determined of banks and mining conglomerates. Sandton is growing as fast and is as affluent as any American sunbelt city. In some ways, Johannesburg\u2019s gated settlements, literal recreations of medieval walled cities, could be seen not as a reflection of American suburbs, but as predictions for what they may one day be like.<\/p>\n<p>The prospect of the skyscrapers of the central business district being taken over by Nigerian traders, and hemmed in by street markets selling traditional remedies and bush meat, and of formerly affluent white suburbs being turned into no go areas, can at times look like a real life version of JG Ballard\u2019s dystopias. Indeed there is something about the mood of the skyline of downtown Johannesburg that suggests Shanghai\u2019s art deco bund, marooned in Mao\u2019s China.<\/p>\n<p>The reality is that Johannesburg is facing many of the same issues as its American and European peers.But in addition it has to deal with the prospect of a tragic drop in population \u2013 caused by the appalling mortality of AIDS and TB.The death rate among young adults is a phenomenon that is already facing the city with the need to find ways to protect the property rights of child heads of households.<\/p>\n<p>Johannesburg has the economic potential to address the challenges that it faces, and to share its wealth with a wider section of the community. Its attempts at urban regeneration have started to have an effect on the city.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":null,"article_publishing_date":"July 2006","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"96","name":"Ilana","created":"2011-11-01 14:12:00","modified":"2011-11-01 14:12:00","slug":null,"family_name":"Ron","title":null,"email_address":null,"photo_legacy":null,"profile_text":null,"organization":null,"role":null,"additional_affiliations":null,"qualifications":null,"staff_pages_blurb":null,"office_location":null,"display_after":null,"display_until":null,"extended_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb_lang2":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation_lang2":null,"phone_number":null}],"attachments":false,"gallery":{"slug":false,"extra_classes":"","slides":[]}},{"request_language":"","current_page_uri":"\/media\/search-dev.json","lang2_slug":false,"lang2_name":false,"parent_publication_id":3,"featured_image_uri":"","article_title":"Johannesburg: Public Life and Urban Space","permalink":"johannesburg-public-life-and-urban-space","article_subtitle":null,"article_abstract":"","article_summary":"","article_text":"<h1>MAKING PUBLIC LIFE<\/h1>\n<p>Say \u2018Public Space and Urban Life\u2019 in Johannesburg and people will probably view you with suspicion.\u2018What on earth do you mean by that?\u2019 they are likely to ask. Do you mean the streets of kasi (the township), where we hang out on weekends? Or downtown Joburg,where the pavements are lined with endless piles of tomatoes, bananas and cheap Chinese clothing? Or the traffic intersections where the poor try to sell us coat hangers, bin bags or a blind relative? Or do you mean Joubert Park,where the unemployed spend all day lying sleeping in the sun? Or Zoo Lake, whose car park is turned into a luxury car showroom by Lenasia\u2019s youth every Sunday afternoon? Or the Mary Fitzgerald Square in Newtown, which the City has successfully managed to sanitise and strip of all life? Or no, perhaps, you mean the malls of Rosebank, where the trendy swank, or the Nelson Mandela Square in Sandton,where we all imagine ourselves to be in Italy? Well, in fact, I mean all of the above. For all are spaces in which the cocoons of private worlds are exited for a while, to meet friends, rub shoulders with strangers and construct the public life of the city.Yet what kind of public life and what kind of city is this?<\/p>\n<p>Under apartheid, public space and urban life was colour coded. Black and white lives might have brushed shoulders, but they inhabited different worlds, or rather the world they inhabited meant very different things.Where they did intersect, a whole administrative apparatus of laws, bylaws, prohibitions and punishments was mobilised against this intersection. This denial of common rights or a common destiny produced a dual city and a dual nation, diverse urban worlds existing side by side in the same geographical space.<\/p>\n<p>This legacy underpins the kinds of public life and urban space taking shape today. The first kind is formed in commemoration of the struggle against apartheid. A number of symbolic public buildings and spaces serve as sites for the mobilisation of new collective histories and bodies. For instance, the Walter Sisulu Square of Dedication in Kliptown, commissioned by international competition in 2001, celebrates the 1955 signing of the ANC\u2019s liberation manifesto, the Freedom Charter. This monumentally scaled square is lined by parallel loggias containing a 3,000 seat hall, art gallery,museum, offices, shops and, as yet unoccupied small scale trading spaces.Annual national commemorative events fill the space,which is otherwise however starkly dislocated from the bustle of daily life around it.<\/p>\n<p>The second kind is underpinned by the culture of protest, now centred on human rights, civility and the independence of the rule of law.New and old forms of public associational life (Trades Unions, The Treatments Action Campaign, the Homeless People\u2019s Movement etc) visibly assert the rights and demands of people on the streets of the city. At the same time, others (religious sects, continental migrant networks, criminal syndicates etc) pursue modes of associational life based on principles of invisibility, rendering the city\u2019s streets fluid and secretive.<\/p>\n<p>Given the intractability of apartheid\u2019s urban geography,many of Johannesburg\u2019s citizens spend large parts of their day in cars, trains or mini-bus taxis, travelling from their places of residence to work and back.This daily migratory pattern offers endless opportunities for the elaboration of public life, or at least for the interaction of strangers in public space.Traffic intersections, highway verges, train carriages,minibus taxis and their ranks have become intense orchestrations of public and private interest. In the inner city, nodal interchanges \u2013 Jack Mincer Square,Metro Mall and Faraday Market \u2013 attempt to align these. Their spatial, programmatic and aesthetic arrangements construct new hybrid urban typologies, new sites of contestation and new modes of urban life.<\/p>\n<p>At the same time, in Johannesburg\u2019s post apartheid economy, an instant, spectacularly wealthy (and increasingly black) \u00e9lite have emerged. Life is centred around money, its acquisition and display.Habits of lavish spending, on the body, cars and houses and their interiors, fuel a consumer economy of dizzying proportions.Architecture constructs the public theatres of consumption and display in this economy \u2013 the shopping centres, casinos, homes, clubs, bars, restaurants and gyms \u2013 in and through which wealth and its signifiers circulate. Ersatz places like the Nelson Mandela Square,Melrose Arch, and Montecasino become the centres of this middle class world. They offer the opportunity to forget the racial city by gazing into magical mirrors of frozen and imaginary pasts,while, at the same time, reducing public space to sites where private interest and consumer choice dominate.<\/p>\n<p>Living in Johannesburg today then, as a vast experiment in how to inhabit apartheid\u2019s ruins, exhibits a number of contradictory tendencies. On the one hand, its nascent public life is taking shape around new official narratives, modes of associational life, meanings of money and everyday travail. On the other hand, its public space is viewed and experienced by many as out of control and dangerous. It is bounded on by fences, palisades, walls, gates, private security guards, cameras and other defensive security technologies. Public life withdraws into the interiority of the private realm (hotels, homes, malls, gated enclaves etc) and urban space is abandoned to featurelessness and neglect.Building more robust intersections between the two becomes a priority.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":null,"article_publishing_date":"July 2006","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"99","name":"Lindsay","created":"2011-11-01 14:23:55","modified":"2011-11-01 14:23:55","slug":null,"family_name":"Bremner","title":null,"email_address":null,"photo_legacy":null,"profile_text":null,"organization":null,"role":null,"additional_affiliations":null,"qualifications":null,"staff_pages_blurb":null,"office_location":null,"display_after":null,"display_until":null,"extended_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb_lang2":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation_lang2":null,"phone_number":null}],"attachments":false,"gallery":{"slug":false,"extra_classes":"","slides":[]}},{"request_language":"","current_page_uri":"\/media\/search-dev.json","lang2_slug":false,"lang2_name":false,"parent_publication_id":11,"featured_image_uri":"","article_title":"Kartal","permalink":"kartal","article_subtitle":"","article_abstract":"<p>\u00d6mer \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu summarises the unique qualities of this historic neighbourhood, and plans by Zaha Hadid to remake it.<\/p>\n","article_summary":"","article_text":"<p><div id=\"attachment_748\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-748\" title=\"17_00\" src=\"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/11\/17_001.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"583\" \/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">View of Kartal District.<\/p><\/div>\n<p>As Niyazi watched the sun set over the Princes\u2019 Islands, a sea of multiple-storey concrete apartments merged with his view. With no formal planning or architectural education, Kartal\u2019s representative of the Platform for Istanbul\u2019s Neighbourhood Associations speaks a language that holds sway in municipal negotiations. He is treading the fine line between both the Kartal District and Istanbul Metropolitan Municipalities, as well as the landowners, and a UK-based architectural office, Niyazi eloquently speaks on behalf of the 10,000 fellow-residents of H\u00fcrriyet, his neighbourhood located on the hills behind Kartal. He knew most of the residents, who settled through mass-migration in the 1970s, fought hard to obtain \u2018amnesty registry\u2019 for their illegally constructed houses, which started off as single-storey buildings but have now turned into multi-storey residencies, hosting extended families and relatives. He has been part of the negotiations during the development of the famous Kartal redevelopment project. Soon, Niyazi\u2019s view could alter completely: overlooking a wavy array of glass and steel towers with a luxury yacht marina on its tail.<\/p>\n<p>Kartal lies in the south-east of Istanbul, stretching from the Marmara Sea in its South, with an elevation of up to 500 metres towards its water and green reservoirs, surrounded by the TEM motorway to its North. The district encompasses over 68 km2. Decades of growth rates of nearly 50 per cent saw the population reach a total of 427,156 consisting of white-collar workers, small-scale tradesmen and industrialists. Like many other peripheral districts in Istanbul, it has grown immensely since the 1950s, with migration coming into its heavily industrialised areas. A lack of implementation of development plans saw 85 per cent of the housing stock made up of poor concrete material, many of which are illegal, and 25 per cent of the population still living in <em>gecekondus<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>It is connected to the rest of the city and beyond via the E-5 and TEM motorways, the suburban railway and the municipal and inter-city ferries from the Kartal pier. The planned Kad\u0131k\u00f6y \u2013 Kartal metro extension and the completion of the Marmaray rail and upgrade of the suburban rail system are aimed at making Kartal a major transport hub. With its close proximity to Sabiha G\u00f6k\u00e7en Airport and attractions such as the Istanbul Formula 1 track, the newly developing Pendik \u2018silicon valley\u2019, and Sabanc\u0131 University, Kartal has become the obvious candidate to be designated as a new sub-centre, and a major tool in Istanbul\u2019s de-centralisation policies. Creating a new central business district in Kartal aims to alleviate the pressure from the city centre and its northern axis, while creating 100,000 new jobs and affecting a grand population of 2 million in the region.<\/p>\n<p>Around 5.5 km2 of the derelict industrial area was part of an urban design competition, won by Zaha Hadid Architects in 2006. This regeneration plan, consistent with the city\u2019s ambitions of bringing in signature architects, sits alongside other ambitious projects in Europe, the scale of which resembles the likes of the HafenCity in Hamburg.<\/p>\n<p>The Kartal redevelopment project is championed by many as the first large-scale redevelopment project in Istanbul that involves all key actors during its realisation: the respective municipalities, the landowners\/developers, the masterplanners and architect as well as the local residents. Initiated by the IMP, it has created its own landowners\u2019 association, formed by some 26 main landowners who pursue negotiation via a designated urban negotiator, whose job is to maintain the communication between all the actors involved. The large-scale masterplan was approved by Kartal municipality, governed by an AKP Mayor prior to 2009 local elections. However, construction cannot start until 1:1000 scale, local development plans are put into place.<\/p>\n<p>In March 2009, Kartal, a district whose residents traditionally vote social-democrat, re-elected a mayor from the Republican People\u2019s Party (CHP), ending the short AKP reign. This halted the preparation of the 1:1000 local development plans for the regeneration project. As of July 2009, the IMP representatives were hopeful to get the plans approved by the new mayor Dr. Alt\u0131nok \u00d6z, with the aim to begin construction in 2010. However, as the global financial gloom has yet to dissolve, main landowner\/developers, such as the Eczac\u0131ba\u015f\u0131 Holding, have yet to confirm the likelihood of this scenario[6]. It will take at least another couple of years of bargaining before the Kartal skyline changes, but when it does it will become the signature of a new way of urban redevelopment in Istanbul. Until then, who the new residents in Kartal will be who in due course can see the effects, shall remain a mystery.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":"http:\/\/v0.urban-age.net\/publications\/newspapers\/istanbul\/articles\/17_OmerCavusoglu\/en_GB\/17_OmerCavusoglu_en.pdf","article_publishing_date":"November 2009","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"38","name":"\u00d6mer","created":"2011-10-04 14:30:59","modified":"2014-04-11 14:51:33","slug":"cavusoglu-omer","family_name":"\u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu","title":"","email_address":"o.cavusoglu@lse.ac.uk","photo_legacy":"\/0_images\/02-OCavusoglu.jpg","profile_text":"","organization":"LSE Cities, London School of Economics and Political Science","role":"Project Manager","additional_affiliations":"","qualifications":"BA\nMSc","staff_pages_blurb":"\u00d6mer \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu holds a BA in Social and Political Sciences and an MSc in City Design and Social Science.

I\u2019m profoundly envious at the capacity of Brazilians to do just about everything with flair and panache. Rewind to the dramatic waves of colour that filled Brazilian streets when citizens (with diverse and divergent agendas) decided to give FIFA the proverbial finger in protest against the absurdity of the World Cup investment requirements in terms of cost, extravagance and loss of sovereignty. As our social media and television screens illuminated with surreal admixtures of carnival, political theatre, street battles and militant uprisings, South Africans despaired at their incapacity to pull off the same levels of mass resistance and imaginative protest when the FIFA regime passed through our neck of the woods.<\/p>\n<p>This powerful display of popular revolt was striking, because for years I have been admiring the variety of innovative urban policy and management instruments under construction across Brazil as city governments, citizens and civil society laboured to give effect to the provisions in the Statute of the City. In other words, not only did Brazilians fare much better than most at democratising their cities, but now they also seem to be singular in changing the rules of engagement when it comes to hosting beauty-pageant-like mega-events. Democratic envy was definitely in order.<\/p>\n<p>Brazil\u2019s urban policy innovations include a willingness to tackle the thorny issue of landownership by introducing new legal criteria that stipulate that the social value of property trumps private rights. A provision that is exclusively in the realm of dreams and fantasy for South Africans labouring under the effects of colonial-Apartheid practices of land dispossession and the concomitant concentration of wealth in the hands of the white minority.<\/p>\n<p>Another dimension of the Brazilian approach has been the profoundly important legal acknowledgement that irregular and informal ways of building cities are a fact of contemporary life and need to be understood and supported \u2013 i.e. regularised \u2013 if cities are going to come to terms with their own essence. It has taken democratic South Africa more than a decade to come to this conclusion as reflected in the Breaking New Ground policy adopted in 2004. But until now the government remains tentative and fearful to give full expression to this commitment. The dominant urban policy approach in South Africa since 1994 has been to see informal settlements as an aberration that needs excising through the provision of freestanding public housing; a model that could only be realised on the peripheries of cities in mono-functional settlements devoid of public life, social infrastructure, and economic activity. It was, and remains, a profoundly top-down model in which the government bestows its munificence on a \u2018grateful\u2019 citizenry. This legacy stands in sharp contrast to the implicit Brazilian confidence in the capacity and power of ordinary citizens to take control of the consolidation and incremental formalisation of their neighbourhoods, connected with intelligent design.<\/p>\n<p>In this regard it is instructive to cite the impressive campaign of the S\u00e3o Paulo municipality to run a national competition \u2013 Renova SP \u2013 to secure the proposals and services of interdisciplinary teams, led by architects, to address the unique conditions of <em>favelas<\/em> in the city. Significantly, the purpose of the competition was to promote innovative design proposals on the explicit assertion that auto-constructed communities reflect a form of tenacious urbanism that should be acknowledged and respected, with an eye to incorporating its logics into proposals for consolidation, informed by the opinions and desires of the residents themselves.<sup>1<\/sup> Despite the fact that South Africa has processed well over 3.2 million public housing opportunities since 1994, it is inconceivable that architects or other urban designers are ever enrolled in these processes. Instead, South Africa remains wedded to a Fordist roll-out model of poorly designed, poorly constructed, and anti-contextual public housing, making an already difficult context a lot worse.<\/p>\n<p>This example underscores a profound cultural and epistemic difference between the Latin and African contexts. Brazil, and most other Latin American countries, comes from a tradition in which urbanism is fused in the cauldron of architecture, design, philosophy and social theory. In the African context, design-based disciplines are generally invisible but also disconnected from thought about the social and political life of cities. As a result, Latin urbanists see the city as a coy lover; a sensual challenge that can only be engaged through a subtle mixture of paying careful attention, seduction, experimentation, and a deep commitment to understanding and supporting it to realise its full potential. In contrast, African urbanists perceive the city as a stubborn, naughty and irredeemable stepchild in need of stern discipline and paternalistic\/authoritarian guidance.<\/p>\n<p>It is for this reason that it is absolutely consistent for many Brazilian city governments to recognise the importance of slum upgrading, public culture and social infrastructure in activating the energies of neighbourhoods and the city at large. According to Teresa Caldeira, the penetration of democracy can be seen in the degree to which living conditions of people in the peripheries have improved: \u2018In spite of continuing poverty, in the past decades urban infrastructure and the material quality of space in S\u00e3o Paulo have improved considerably, thus bettering the conditions of the life of the poor in the improved peripheries.\u2019<sup>2<\/sup> This in turn, she points out, has given rise to a number of rogue and unpredictable cultural practices, especially among the youth in Brazilian cities.<\/p>\n<p>Of course I am not as na\u00efve as to believe that Brazilian cities have got it all figured out, or that any of the suite of urban reform measures instituted by the Statute of Cities work perfectly. I accept the conclusions drawn by Edesio Fernandes on the remaining challenges surrounding participatory budgeting, masterplanning processes to concretise social zoning, slum upgrading and so forth.<sup>3<\/sup> Yet, the vibrant Brazilian experiment in democratic and inclusive city building remains profoundly important for debates in South Africa and other members of the BRICS axis. A brief update on contemporary developments in South Africa in the urban domain will clarify this assertion.<\/p>\n<p>In 2012, the National Planning Commission unveiled a twenty-year plan for South Africa. The plan asserts:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Reshaping South Africa\u2019s cities, towns and rural settlements is a complex, long-term project requiring major reforms and political will. It is, however, a necessary project given the enormous social, environmental and financial costs imposed by existing spatial divides. [\u2026] Transforming human settlements is a large and complex agenda requiring far-reaching policy changes and shifts in household, business and government practices. Planning for transformation happens within an uncertain context and requires foresight, resilience and versatility, as well as updated information and continually revised knowledge.\u2019<sup>4<\/sup> This statement reflects a coming of age in the urban policy debates in South Africa. In its wake, the national government commissioned the preparation of the Integrated Urban Development Framework. This policy is likely to make a strong case for a number of the elements of the Brazilian model to be indigenised in the South African context, alongside a strong push for reorienting urban policy to foster resilient and inclusive cities as a central strand in the national efforts to foster a green economy.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>It is envisaged that city-wide, long-term planning and management instruments such as growth management strategies will have to be produced for all major cities and towns. These will have to articulate spatial frameworks, infrastructure plans, land assembly strategies, and resource efficiency targets connected to innovative financing tools. It is self-evident that the Brazilian experience with masterplanning and social zoning will prove instructive for South Africa.<\/p>\n<p>These macro frameworks at the city-wide or regional scale will need to be reinforced by neighbourhood-level planning and community management systems. Since citizens will be central to the formulation of these, public investments will be required to engender citizen skills in spatial literacy, budget interpretation and community project management. Again, the now deeply entrenched methodologies of community-driven planning and management in many Brazilian <em>favelas<\/em> can offer crucial insights. Moreover, South Africa will have to draw heavily on the rich tradition of participatory design that has become the hallmark of radical incrementalism across many Brazilian and Latin American cities such as Medell\u00edn and Rio de Janeiro. My hunch and hope is that such exposure could make the difference in changing the mindsets of South African policy makers and citizens so that they too can fall in love with their imperfect cities.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"<p><sup>1<\/sup> For details on the competition and its outcomes, see S\u00e3o Paulo Municipality, (2011) Renova SP.

Do they consider them healthy? How do they feel the density and the design of their neighbourhood impacts on their health and well-being, if at all? LSE Cities and the University of Hong Kong\u2019s Hong Kong Jockey Club Centre for Suicide Research and Prevention conducted interviews with groups of residents in different parts of the city. The aim of this study was to offer more subjective perspectives on the spatial dynamics of health and well-being in one of the densest cities in the world, giving voice to individual residents that goes beyond the spatial analysis of quantitative indicators.<br \/> During the summer of 2011, researchers met with a selection of 32 young, middle-aged and elderly people who lived in three distinct areas to get a sense of how different age groups responded to their high-density environments. The first group lives in Whampoa, a relatively new, middle-class estate on the south coast of Kowloon with a residential density1 of 74,200 people per square kilometre. Residents from Sai Ying Pun, one of Hong Kong\u2019s original settlement areas on Hong Kong Island, with a residential density of 79,200 people per square kilometre, made up the second group, while the third was comprised by inhabitants of apartments in Sham Shui Po, Kowloon, a busy shopping and lower-income residential district of older, \u2018walk-up\u2019 buildings, with a very high residential density of 92,200 people per square kilometre. While some of the residents live in extremely tall towers more than 30 storeys high and others in older, cramped ten-storey blocks arranged along traditional streets, all three areas in Hong Kong have density levels that are higher than New York\u2019s most concentrated neighbourhoods in the Upper East Side and more than four times as high as the densest areas in London.<br \/> The focus group participants were asked to discuss a wide range of issues, including their experiences of living in tall buildings, how they use private and public space, where and how social relationships were enacted, how they rated their neighbourhood in terms of access to amenities and transport, how easy it is to get to work and how pollution and space constraints affect their daily lives. What follows is an initial analysis of their discussions, which begins to develop a narrative of what it means to live at high densities in Hong Kong. Perhaps the overall sentiment is best captured by Shan, an 18-year-old student living in the new development in Whampoa, who states:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Although Hong Kong is dense, it is still convenient. We don\u2019t have to spend a long time travelling to the destination. Amenity-wise \u2026 it is good enough.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Or by Ms Fok\u2019s observation, as a 53-year-old retired mother living in Sai Ying Pun, that:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Time matters in Hong Kong.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>On balance the responses from all three areas suggest that Hong Kong\u2019s \u2018convenience\u2019 and accessibility are highly valued both by young and old residents. \u2018Convenience\u2019 was repeatedly used to describe the positive trade-offs that Hong Kong\u2019s dense urban fabric affords to its residents. Public transport is seen as being generally very good \u2013 reflecting the city\u2019s highly efficient and extensive Mass Transit Rail (MTR) and bus system \u2013 and the range and quantity of services and amenities was considered excellent, including restaurants and canteens serving food from all over the world, swimming pools, badminton courts and sports centres, clinics and hospitals, as well as libraries and community centres. It is the \u2018many Hong Kongs\u2019 \u2013 the great range of amenities and services provided by even the smaller neighbourhoods \u2013 which the residents of Whampoa, Sai Ying Pun and Sham Shui Po seem to value the most.<br \/> The three neighbourhoods provide different advantages to residents in terms of convenience and accessibility. Located across the bay from Hong Kong Island in Kowloon, residents of Whampoa are attracted by the spectacular views and access to the harbour and also by the convenient access to a wide range of local amenities, including schools, private clinics, Chinese herbalists, restaurants and shopping malls. The design of multi-storey apartment blocks with ground-level gardens and badminton courts were seen as positive assets. Despite not yet having its own MTR station, local residents considered Whampoa to be highly accessible even though the recent loss of the cross-harbour ferry connection to Central \u2013 Hong Kong\u2019s primary business and finance district \u2013 was regretted by the young people. As 18-year-old Shan says: \u2018There is no traffic jam in the sea.\u2019<br \/> In the much older and poorer district of Sham Shui Po, in northwest Kowloon, residents appreciate the presence of a nearby MTR station and the many bus connections: Aunt Kwok, a disabled and retired 73-year-old says, \u2018I think we have the best transport here. I moved into the area here just because of this.\u2019 Immediate access to goods, shops and markets in a relatively low-cost area is seen as an advantage, given the availability of \u2018cheap and fresh food, groceries [and] affordable rents\u2019, noted by Mr Fung, a 63-year-old resident of the area. While Sham Shui Po is often defined by its relatively out-dated and often overcrowded walk-up blocks, it clearly also provides amenities<br \/> and connections that its lower-income residents value.<br \/> In the historical district of Sai Ying Pun on Hong Kong Island, residents appreciate its proximity to a number of civic amenities such as schools, markets and libraries as well as easy access to the extensive job market provided by the offices and shops of Central. The presence of open public spaces was a major talking point for focus group participants, including the King George V Memorial Park and the University of Hong Kong, with their extensive grounds and facilities, accessible to the public, which provide open space and clean air right at the heart of this highly built-up district of Hong Kong. Located in a part of the city with steep gradients, residents (especially elderly ones) regretted the lack of a local MTR station, though they appreciated good bus services to Central. Residents were clear about the trade-offs of living in a relatively congested yet well-connected area. In Whampoa, Edmond, aged 44 and self-employed, offered his analysis of the trade-offs facing all<br \/> Hong Kongers:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>You cannot have your cake and eat it &#8230; if you live in Tai Po [in the New Territories], there are more trees and plants, but it takes you longer to travel to Kowloon. You\u2019ve got to make a choice: either a better environment or a more convenient place.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>While to varying degrees, Hong Kong\u2019s \u2018convenience\u2019 comes at a cost in terms of living and leisure spaces, it was nonetheless striking to hear that, despite these trade-offs, some focus group members dreamt of living above where they worked in order to save travelling time. Others aspired to living in larger houses, a sentiment expressed by Mrs Shek, a 45-year-old mother living in Sai Ying Pun, who noted, \u2018of course I wish to live in a house, when I went to Canada, I was envious of their houses \u2026 sure! There\u2019s a front yard and backyard for planting, and the air is good \u2026 this is a dream!\u2019 Such dreams seemed to be out of reach for many residents, a problem exacerbated by the recent property price rises in Hong Kong. As Helen, a 33-year-old woman who works in finance and lives in Whampoa, said: \u2018It\u2019s tough for people like me \u2026 to buy a larger flat \u2026 It would be easier to achieve this dream in the old days because the property price now is really high.\u2019 As in other cities, income inequality is reflected in the property market, reaching the sort of extremes identified by 22-year-old Peter, who works in a luxurious Kowloon development and lives in Sham Shui Po: \u2018Some people own an indoor 800-square-foot swimming pool that is eight times as big as my apartment. We are just talking about their swimming pool.\u2019<br \/> A good location helps adults to juggle demanding jobs, long working hours and family and domestic responsibilities. Middle-aged people tend to choose a location that is close to their children\u2019s schools and their place of work, often sacrificing space and comfort in the process. Ms Fok, the 53-year-old retired mother living in Sai Ying Pun, says, \u2018We have kids, and we have to cater for their needs. My daughter studies here too, and she said it\u2019s very convenient because she works in Central. It only costs HK$2 (US 25 cents) to travel by tram. She goes to work at 9.30am, and she could get up at 8.30am \u2026 so she thinks it\u2019s ok.\u2019 She concludes that, \u2018time matters in Hong Kong\u2019; a comment that seems to capture the particular nature of this city\u2019s socio-spatial character.<br \/> The focus group discussions brought connections between these Hong Kong residents\u2019 demand for space and work pressures into sharp focus. It was clear that many of the middle-aged residents were so busy working that they spent little time at home. As a result, the size of their living space and the quality of the local environment were not such a high priority as they might otherwise have been. Victor, a 46-year-old manufacturing worker living in Whampoa, explains: \u2018I have long working hours so when I go home, I mainly want to get myself rested\u2019. This is a view echoed by Mrs Shek, who commented: \u2018I may choose convenience because \u2026 honestly, when I go home after work, it\u2019s dark outside, so no matter how wonderful the views are, I can\u2019t enjoy [them].\u2019<br \/> For the most deprived Hong Kongers, however, the trade-offs between convenience and living environment can mean living in extremely cramped conditions \u2013 in subdivided or partitioned flats, cubicles or even \u2018cage homes\u2019. The older buildings of Sham Shui Po have in many cases been adapted in this way to accommodate as many tenants as possible. For Aunt Kwok the stress and anxiety of ending up in such conditions is palpable. \u2018Those subdivided flats are not suitable for me\u2019, she states, \u2018all those rooms have two raised-levels [in order to hide the re-adjusted pipes and ducts], I cannot raise my legs [to move from one level to another] \u2026 For those flats that aren\u2019t subdivided, people are not willing to rent them to a single old-lady \u2026 I cannot find [one]. My head is aching.\u2019<br \/> But lack of space at home does not just trouble those at the lower end of Hong Kong\u2019s social scale, as Mrs Shek notes:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>I think it directly influences our living and our social lives \u2026 I don\u2019t really want to have babies too, so I just have one \u2026 my son is 17 years old \u2026 our home is too cramped. His own space is just his room, he could reach it one step after entering the flat, and one more step to his desk, another to his bed.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Despite the rationalisation of the choices they make, living in such small spaces was a cause of concern for most of the Hong Kongers we spoke to. When Lemo, a 31-year-old graduate student, moved to Sai Ying Pun from mainland China, he changed his social habits to adjust to Hong Kong\u2019s smaller living spaces. He explained: \u2018In Hong Kong I won\u2019t ask to visit my friends\u2019 houses because our flats are too small, I don\u2019t even know where to place my legs \u2026 my friends from the mainland came to my place and they asked whether they could sleep on the floor and I said no, so I won\u2019t invite them to my place. I\u2019ve formed this habit since I came to Hong Kong.\u2019 Mrs Fok, the 53-year-old retiree living in the same area, also changed her behaviour after an embarrassing experience some years ago: \u2018I wasn\u2019t experienced and I was so happy that I invited my colleagues to my home. The gross floor area was merely 300 feet, it was so cramped that \u2026 everyone sat in rows as if they were at the cinema \u2026 they said I had overestimated myself because I invited my friends to such a tiny flat, so since then I\u2019ve never invited anyone to my home.\u2019 Apart from the impositions on individual habits and routines caused by the physical constraints of small apartments, impacts on patterns of socialisation with friends and family were also clearly felt by many residents, whether old or young, newly arrived or long established.<br \/> The physical proximity to neighbouring properties was felt by many residents to have negative consequences on the quality of life within their already small living spaces, requiring them to further adapt to their micro-environments, in particular to defend their sense of privacy. As Mrs Ng, a 58-year-old retired woman living in Sai Ying Pun explained: \u2018you can touch the flat next to yours if you reach out your hands\u2019. Adapting to the proximity of others involves closing windows and curtains in order to avoid seeing and been seen by neighbours, to avoid watching their TVs, smelling their food or hearing their quarrels at night. Helen, the Whampoa resident, says, \u2018I have to draw the curtains when I\u2019m at home, because it really makes me uncomfortable. It\u2019s not a matter of whether I can do what I want, but it\u2019s just too close to the next flat that I can even notice [when] they walk, sit and watch TV.\u2019 Apart from the obvious amenity value afforded by better views and daylight, higher-level apartments are often valuable and desired because of the relative privacy they afford residents. Phoebe, a 29-year-old resident of Sham Shui Po says, \u2018I [would] prefer living on a higher floor \u2026 You get a better view. It\u2019s not just about that. It\u2019s also about the distance between you and your neighbour, the sense of spaciousness.\u2019<br \/> Focus group participants reported that, on the whole, there was little interaction with immediate neighbours, and that residents preferred not to intrude on each others\u2019 private space. Phoebe explained it further, \u2018Hong Kong people are quite cool and detached. People seldom greet their neighbour because they are quite concerned about their private space. People may find it disturbing.\u2019 Ivan, Anthony and Michael, three young residents of Whampoa, discussed the same issue. Ivan said, \u2018it\u2019s difficult to ask for their names. My dad would ask &#8230; it\u2019s never like the old days,\u2019 while Anthony felt that the interaction between neighbours \u2018cannot apply to the Hong Kong context and culture. We would not say \u201chi\u201d to others on the street. It\u2019s weird.\u2019 Michael elaborated, \u2018if someone says \u201chi\u201d to me [in the hallway], I will be scared\u2019. The contradiction between physical proximity and social distance seems be captured by the observations of these young Hong Kong residents.<br \/> Environmental problems, especially noise and air pollution, loom large in the concerns of this group of Hong Kongers, and in many cases cause them to further protect and enclose their already small living spaces. Lemo, the 31-year-old graduate student living in Sai Ying Pun, provides a clear explanation for his desire to go high, stating that \u2018the air is poor from the first floor to the fourth floor because the roads are so busy and the noise pollution is serious \u2026 so in Sai Ying Pun I would choose [to live in] high-rise buildings\u2019. Residents are often compelled to close their windows or buy extra thick curtains to escape from the pollution, despite the stifling temperatures that accompany the summer months in Hong Kong. Ms Shek notes that \u2018there are ways to escape from noise \u2026 any method will do\u2019, while Ms Kwong, a 61-year-old living in Sham Shui Po explains, \u2018if the neighbouring flat has their air conditioner turned on, the hot air from their air conditioner would affect you. So everyone now has to turn on their air conditioners. Otherwise you\u2019ll have to tolerate the hot air &#8230; The air quality is not so good and I always cough.\u2019 Such comments give a sense of how closely built form, health and well-being relate in these high-density living environments.<br \/> Residents of Sham Shui Po, the most deprived and dense of the three neighbourhoods, seemed to experience particularly severe environmental problems. Mr Au, aged 65 and retired, explained: \u2018If you want to know whether it\u2019s dirty here, you just place a fan at home, and if it doesn\u2019t turn dusty after one week, it means the air is fresh. But if it turns dusty, it means the air is not good. It\u2019s that simple \u2026 I have to clean mine every week.\u2019 He connected the problem of air pollution to the planning and design of Hong Kong\u2019s high-density environment, saying, \u2018There were only four buildings in Un Chau Estate. Now, the air-flow is blocked by the \u201cwalled buildings\u201d \u2026 You think of it, Feng Shui is not something useless &#8230; It is so hot after the south [passage] was blocked \u2026 It wasn\u2019t so dusty in the past. The environment keeps deteriorating.\u2019<br \/> The effects of living in small areas and in close proximity to others can be better understood if we also take into account how residents look to \u2018compensate\u2019 for their limited privacy by creating their own private space within the public realm, making use of the street, restaurants, shopping malls and sports facilities both for meeting friends and for having time to themselves. As Mrs Shek from Sai Ying Pun says,<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>People would chat on street at night \u2026 especially teenagers, [who] don\u2019t have their own space at home, it isn\u2019t big enough &#8230; they all grab a beer and sit in front of Kau Yan [school]. <\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Edmond, the 44-year-old living in the new developments in Whampoa, reflected, \u2018maybe people in Hong Kong are used to not having a private space, so we don\u2019t mind not having one \u2026 and we\u2019re not desirous of it \u2026 when you really need a private space you can actually create one \u2026 even a 24-hour Cha Chaan Teng [Chinese eatery] can be a private space\u2019. For Helen, the finance worker living in Whampoa, the main thing is getting out of the house: \u2018I\u2019m usually in Whampoa \u2026 we go to have something to eat \u2026 We also go to the cinema \u2026 Yes, karaoke \u2026 swimming \u2026 eating \u2026 cinema \u2026 I don\u2019t like staying at home so I just wander around in Whampoa.\u2019 Many options are available. As Mr Kwok, a retired man from Sham Shui Po, says: \u2018I like playing horizontal bar and gymnastics and I can do that in Un Chau Estate, where I live \u2026 Yes, there are many kinds of activities provided \u2026 There is the library, basketball and squash courts, as well as table tennis.\u2019 Some places used for exercising turned out to be quite surprising. Ms Fok, the 53-year-old retiree from Sai Ying Pun, explained how the nearby Cargo Working Area is used at night, when it is empty, by elderly people for exercising. She says, \u2018at least that is really a public space where you can have some activities there \u2026 how could you move in your tiny flat? You couldn\u2019t!\u2019 For many of the young residents, who are accustomed to contemporary technologies, listening to music through earphones contributes to the creation of a personal space, even when surrounded by other people. Cherry, an 18-year-old student living in Whampoa, said, \u2018it\u2019s like quarantining myself \u2026 we do not bother each other even though we sit there next to each other \u2026 no one can intrude\u2019.<br \/> However, most of the focus group participants from the three areas agreed that Hong Kong and its services, public spaces and facilities were overcrowded to the point where they could not access them or where they had to adjust their behaviour significantly in order to do so. Steve, a 31-year-old worker living in Whampoa, explains the phenomenon clearly: \u2018When you shop and eat in a particular community \u2026 if there are a lot of people, you may have to queue, and then you don\u2019t want to shop anymore. Like if you were at a crowded supermarket, you would lose the intention to shop. When you dine out, if you had to wait, you would lose the intention again.\u2019 In order to avoid this, residents time their visits to particularly busy areas or shops carefully. Those who can afford to, join private sports clubs and gyms in order to avoid having to battle for access to a public badminton court, where sessions often get booked up within five minutes of reservations opening.<br \/> While the \u2018bustling\u2019 nature of Hong Kong seemed attractive to some residents, there was an overriding sense among most focus group participants that the pace of life and fierceness of competition in Hong Kong was putting increasing pressure on their capacity to cope with the demands of life. As Peter, the 22-year-old living in Sham Shui Po and working in Kowloon, explains:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The pressure at work \u2026 competition \u2026 I think most people in Hong Kong are suffering from some mental problems such as pressures or stress \u2026 Maybe we are more stressed because we live in a financial centre.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The older focus group participants compared Hong Kong to the \u2018old\u2019 (colonial) days, finding life harder today and worrying about the pace of change. As Mr Au, the 65-year-old retiree from Sham Sui Po, says of the change in labour conditions: \u2018Back in the old days during the colonial period, it was not too hard to earn a living, as long as you were hard-working. Right now, you can\u2019t get a job even if you are hard-working \u2026 Back in the old days, who would collect the garbage and newspapers from the streets? No one would do that during the colonial period. Now you can see many old ladies and younger ones doing so.\u2019<br \/> In Sai Ying Pun, the urban renewal programmes underway involve the loss of familiar places and loved restaurants. Parks and playgrounds are being turned into construction sites for the MTR, or replaced by high-rise and high-end hotels and apartment buildings. Mrs Chan, a 65-year-old widow who lives in the district, says, \u2018I can\u2019t see anything beneficial yet [about urban renewal] \u2026 If they build up new ones, the population will increase. There will be more people buying food. Then \u2026 I\u2019m affected [by lack of food].\u2019 Mr Leung, a 63-year-old widower, fears a degradation of his living conditions: \u2018When they finish building at the place of the Bank of East Asia, I won\u2019t have much space around my home \u2026 [I\u2019m] unlikely to be able to look at the sea [from my home]. When they finish building, maybe it\u2019ll block the view.\u2019<br \/> For younger people, the pressures of work often felt overwhelming. Marcus, a 27-year-old graduate living in Sham Shui Po, said, \u2018the mental stress is unimaginable for those who sleep for only three hours every night after tedious work \u2026 you cannot just be an average person or you will be eliminated. You either outrun the competition or you lose. You don\u2019t really have a choice.\u2019 Young people in Whampoa felt the same. As Shan, the 18-year-old student, said,<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>A healthy city is not all about economy and finance. The pace of living is too fast and it\u2019s hard to breathe. People need some time to relax and cool themselves off from the pressure \u2026 You know, people with pressure makes the city unhealthy \u2026 healthiness includes physical and mental [health].<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Victor, the 46-year-old manufacturing worker living in Whampoa, concurred: \u2018Of course bad air quality caused us [to develop] nasal allergies, but what influences the health of Hong Kong people most is the pressure from work \u2026 it doesn\u2019t matter if one is living in a tiny flat, but the pressure from work and the long working hour directly worsen one\u2019s health.\u2019<br \/> The six focus groups held with the 32 residents of three neighbourhoods provide a sense of the ways in which density is felt to impact on health and well-being by residents of different areas and different ages, and this, in turn, begins to make clear how density might be better designed. But more than anything, the discussions make visible the multiple and complex ways in which Hong Kongers themselves make density work, by adapting their behaviour and negotiating their environments. As such, this qualitative research brings to light the many interactions and co-dependencies between the physical and the social environment in some of Hong Kong\u2019s dense neighbourhoods.<br \/> Looking more closely, it is also possible to identify some clear differences between the views and experiences of different age groups and residents of different areas. Concern about the increasing pace of life in Hong Kong and the fierce demands of competitive working life was strongest amongst the youngest participants (aged 18\u201329). For middle-aged participants (aged 30\u201359), these concerns were further complicated by the need to juggle working and family life, especially in small living spaces. Comparing Hong Kong to the colonial days, older participants (aged over 60) felt times were harder today, and felt a sense of loss as the development of Hong Kong continued. Amongst the residents of the three different areas, it was clear that residents of Sham Shui Po experienced their local environments as being more unhealthy than residents of Whampoa and Sai Ying Pun \u2013 relatively more affluent areas with newer and higher-quality buildings, and less polluted environments. These differences emphasise the ways in which Hong Kong residents of different ages and generations relate to their urban environment, and start to make visible the ways in which urban design and planning, density and health and well-being interrelate.<br \/> Perhaps the clearest message emerging from these findings is that Hong Kong is strongly valued by its residents for the convenience and opportunities it affords them. They sacrifice the quality and size of their living environments in order to access and benefit from these opportunities, and adjust their social and family lives accordingly. For many, this is a sacrifice they are willing to make, as they adjust their behaviour in a complex and constant negotiation with the constraints and regulations of their environment. For others, the equation is becoming increasingly difficult to balance \u2013 poor environmental quality is eroding living environments, rising real estate prices are further shrinking floor space and the demands of surviving in competitive employment markets are placing workers under increasing stress. At the same time Hong Kong\u2019s urban fabric is becoming ever denser and processes of urban renewal and infrastructure development destroy public spaces and local amenities, replacing them with high-end hotels and apartment buildings that the real estate market both demands and supplies, generating a sense of loss for many residents. The stories and experiences told by these 32 residents of Whampoa, Sai Ying Pun and Sham Shui Po suggest that living in Hong Kong comes with a price that could be on the verge of becoming too much to pay. This sentiment is perhaps most powerfully communicated by a brief exchange between two young residents of Whampoa, Ivan and Sam (both 22 years of age):<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Ivan: I worry that it [the pace of living in Hong Kong] will become even faster.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>Sam: I cannot accept any faster.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>As one of the world\u2019s densest and healthiest cities, at least in terms of its high life expectancy and low infant mortality, Hong Kong\u2019s experiences may offer insights to city makers and dwellers traversing processes of change in other parts of the world.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/11\/2011_chw_3096_Taylor-Inclan-Valadez-Yip-al.pdf","article_publishing_date":"November 2011","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"142","name":"Sophia G.","created":"2011-11-14 22:01:25","modified":"2011-11-14 22:02:08","slug":null,"family_name":"Chak","title":null,"email_address":null,"photo_legacy":null,"profile_text":null,"organization":null,"role":null,"additional_affiliations":null,"qualifications":null,"staff_pages_blurb":null,"office_location":null,"display_after":null,"display_until":null,"extended_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb_lang2":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation_lang2":null,"phone_number":null},{"id":"141","name":"Cristina","created":"2011-11-14 22:00:07","modified":"2013-01-17 16:59:22","slug":"inclan-valadez-cristina","family_name":"Inclan-Valadez","title":"","email_address":"m.c.inclan-valadez@lse.ac.uk","photo_legacy":"\/0_images\/02-CInclanValadez.jpg","profile_text":"","organization":"LSE Cities, London School of Economics and Political Science","role":"Researcher","additional_affiliations":"","qualifications":"BA\nMSc","staff_pages_blurb":"<p>Cristina Inclan-Valadez has been working over seven years as a researcher and consultant on public health projects, particularly related to road safety and urban mobility, and its links to city planning.

Originally, Taksim means the distribution of water. Today, the currents of popular political culture begin their national trek here.<\/p><\/div>\n<p>In Turkey, the authoritative relationship between state and society is mitigated by the populist political culture. And while the country\u2019s populism has many roots, two main factors have contributed to its prominence: the vital demands from new urban citizens after rapid urbanisation since the 1960s, and an understanding of democracy reduced in its simplest form to voting.<\/p>\n<p>There is no doubt that the will and the need for decentralisation in Turkey accelerated with urbanisation. Since the Turkish central government could neither control the mass urban migration, nor answer the vital demands emanating from the millions of new migrants, the masses produced their own \u2018local solutions\u2019 while public officials merely stood by. In exchange, migrants \u2013 eager to reward populist political parties that promised to tolerate informal job and housing markets \u2013 crowned politicians with votes and political powers. This system persisted until increasing complications stemming from the densification and diversity of urban settlements gave rise to the need for an effective and decentralised urban administration.<\/p>\n<p>The main obstacle to what may be termed \u2018institutional\u2019 localisation in Turkey is democratisation. Partly from fear of an internal fracturing along ethnic lines, especially with regards to the Kurdish population, demands for \u2018decentralisation for democracy\u2019 have not been welcomed by the well-established centrist state tradition. Instead, these calls are framed solely as a technical issue about the effectiveness of an urban administration, rather than about comprehensive political and institutional reform. It is not accidental that during the militarist regime following the coup in 1980, important institutional reforms to metropolitan Istanbul were introduced as part of a larger agenda to establish order and to solve urgent infrastructural problems. What is striking is that relative efficiency in solving urban matters were perceived by urbanites as \u2018democratisations\u2019.<\/p>\n<p>After all, the demands for decentralisation in Turkey run along two different strands: democratisation and efficiency. This is especially true with regards to urbanism, which oscillates between populism and authoritarian rule, two fundamental characteristics of the current political system. From this perspective, it is this dilemma in Istanbul that may be perceived as \u2018chaos\u2019.<\/p>\n<p>In this context, it is necessary to first explain the meaning of the current two-tier structure of Istanbul\u2019s urban administration. Both metropolitan and district municipalities have decision-making powers in so far that the metropolitan administration is responsible for macro-level decisions concerning the entire city, while districts are responsible for decisions related to traditional municipal services. The metropolitan administration of Istanbul, follows the \u2018powerful mayor and weak council\u2019 model, one which enables a wide and non-transparent space for macro-level decision-making and, not surprisingly, favours, the mayors of metropolitan municipalities. Therefore, city-wide decisions are discussed and criticised in the media and by professional associations only after they have been made, thus fuelling rumours and complaints about corruption, criticism on judicial and technical inadequacies, as well as the anti-democratic nature of the decision-making processes.<\/p>\n<p>As with other cities that have grown rapidly and that urgently need solutions for their basic infrastructure problems, city-wide decisions to address the concerns of citizens are vitally important in Istanbul. However, since local administrations are not financially autonomous, they are engaged in a never-ending search for new resources to implement their decisions. Therefore, good relations with the central government are crucial. In Istanbul, most problems have occurred when the political party of the metropolitan municipality differed from that of the central government. At first sight, it is impossible to talk about a central versus local conflict: On the one hand Istanbul&#8217;s local administration and the central government in Ankara are politically aligned and share common political views. On the other hand, the Prime Minister was formerly the mayor of Istanbul, and considers himself as an \u2019Istanbul lover.\u2019 Finally, AKP\u2019s great success in local politics helped them to achieve success at the national level.<\/p>\n<p>However, upon gaining power and its political advantages, the central AKP administration began turning down calls for decentralisation, and instead reinforced their centralist tendencies further. Thus when it comes to the making of macro-level decisions it is possible to say that the central government exerts a strong influence in Istanbul. Moreover, Istanbul\u2019s residents have generally supported decisions taken even by the central government because of their efficiency at the local level.<\/p>\n<p>These non-transparent decisions can be criticised as they violate basic public administrative and democratic principles. The closed, communitarian and disciplined structure of the AKP with a charismatic leadership prevents issues from being discussed more openly. However, rumours about central versus local conflicts do exist, and, what\u2019s more, technical and legal deficiencies in these decisions are discussed among a limited number of professionals. Some of the decisions have been suspended by the legal authorities.<\/p>\n<p>Paradoxically, Istanbulites do not seem to be very interested in how these decisions are made anyway. On the contrary, the fact that fundamental and urgent infrastructural problems are actually being addressed generates popular support. The Prime Minister, seems content that the public recognises and supports the central government\u2019s role in projects concerning the city\u2019s infrastructure. Indeed, these investments can be regarded as a reward for votes: and thus boost populist politics just like social relief for the poor citizens.<\/p>\n<p>Considering this, it is possible to say that Istanbul is being governed by a populist approach closely tied to the central government. In this context, it may be necessary to point out how the city is currently planned. In short, a strategic planning ethos now guides the city\u2019s growth. Responsibility for this strategic vision has been transferred to the Istanbul Metropolitan Planning and Urban Design Centre (IMP), a new organisation that operates alongside political and bureaucratic bodies of the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality. Although the staff of this new organisation possesses expertise, decision-making is still left to the domain of populist politics and projects of the IMP tend to be selectively or only partially implemented, because it does not have administrative and technocratic influence. To sum up, we may claim that the technocrats are excluded from the decision-making process where their knowledge and expertise are extremely important for the city\u2019s aesthetics and long-term growth.<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, the European Union\u2019s nomination process brings with it new influential concepts regarding urban governance. As a result, government bodies and civic groups are trying to identify new models for participation: local administrations have established city councils and are trying to foster stronger ties to civic groups in order to comply with legal obligations connected to these administrative principles.<\/p>\n<p>In this respect, Istanbul\u2019s biggest obstacle is that the majority of its citizens are either not organised or take part in hierarchically structured \u2018community\u2019 groups. Possibilities for open participation remain limited but clientelist-ties become widespread. Another problem concerns the rights of organisations and the freedom of expression among social groups who suffer from the disadvantageous consequences of some urban renewal projects. For example, the Romani community, which used to live in the historical city centre, has been particularly marginalised. Overall, the administrative principle for enhanced governance currently relates only to the existing power groups and excludes the disadvantaged, the marginalised and minorities. However, thanks to Turkey\u2019s nomination to the European Union new concepts have been introduced concerning human and minority rights. Local democracy will arrive to Turkish cities only after it is understood that populism and majority-rule do not equal democracy and that the demands of minority groups have to be taken into consideration.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":"http:\/\/v0.urban-age.net\/publications\/newspapers\/istanbul\/articles\/10_SemaErder\/en_GB\/10_SemaErder_en.pdf","article_publishing_date":"November 2009","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"28","name":"Sema","created":"2011-10-04 13:48:47","modified":"2011-10-04 14:48:47","slug":null,"family_name":"Erder","title":null,"email_address":null,"photo_legacy":null,"profile_text":"","organization":"","role":"","additional_affiliations":null,"qualifications":null,"staff_pages_blurb":null,"office_location":null,"display_after":null,"display_until":null,"extended_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb_lang2":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation_lang2":null,"phone_number":null}],"attachments":false,"gallery":{"slug":false,"extra_classes":"","slides":[]}},{"request_language":"","current_page_uri":"\/media\/search-dev.json","lang2_slug":false,"lang2_name":false,"parent_publication_id":5,"featured_image_uri":"","article_title":"London: Overview","permalink":"london-overview","article_subtitle":"Governing the Ungovernable?","article_abstract":"","article_summary":"","article_text":"<p>The single most arresting fact about London is that it is growing. After decades in which, like every other major European and North American city, it was haemorrhaging people, the victim of the hollowing out doughnut effect, London has turned around. The forecasts now point to sustained and substantial population increases; much of it through migration. Something remarkable has happened here. A combination of an ageing population beginning to understand that the only source of the young and able-bodied that will be needed to care for the baby boomers in their declining years, and to pay the contributions needed to fund their pensions will have to be from outside, and of the booming opportunities for the highly skilled in everything from banking to the art market, have between them transformed the character of the city, and its prospects. The transformation is both reflected in, and in part the product of, a transformed system of city government for London.<\/p>\n<p>Recently, London\u2019s only remaining evening newspaper carried a front page story to the effect that the first directly elected mayor in the city\u2019s history, Ken Livingstone, was so exercised by the thought of his legacy that he intended to run for office for two more terms so as to be able to preside over the opening ceremonies for the Olympics of 2012. The story does not have to be literally true to pose real questions about the impact of the singularly un-British approach to local government that Livingstone represents. After two or more decades of drift, and ambiguity, London as an urban entity now has a clear focus of power. It is a development that is the most startling product of Tony Blair\u2019s local government reforms. They were intended to change the face of all the country\u2019s big cities. London is the one success story of a reform that has elsewhere failed to take root. It should have been the most difficult, and the most unmanageable, and yet it has turned out to be the city in which a change of government, or rather the introduction of a government, has had the most clear cut impact.<\/p>\n<p>Despite his incendiary past as a selfstyled man of the left, Livingstone is clearly now modelling himself on a combination of big city American mayors of the stamp of La Guardia, Koch and Giuliani, with a touch of the imperial style of Francois Mitterrand thrown in, rather than the more restrained tradition of municipal public service. It\u2019s inconceivable that a Labour traditionalist would, as Livingstone has done, earmark \u00a3100,000 from the Greater London Authority\u2019s budget to spend on fighting a public inquiry to defend his personal choice of sculptor for a singularly lifeless tribute to Nelson Mandela destined for Trafalgar Square. Nor would such a figure ever have claimed that it was his duty as mayor to lead, rather than to listen, a destiny manifest in his decisions on everything from questions of aesthetics, to the extension of the congestion charging zone westward.<\/p>\n<p>The intriguing question posed by Livingstone\u2019s highly personal, interventionist style of shaping London in his own image is personified at the most superficial level by the affair of the Mandela statue, and in a much more far reaching way by the eruption of a wall of skyscrapers which have been breaching the 305 metre barrier along Bishopsgate, encouraged by Livingstone\u2019s enthusiasm for creating Europe\u2019s first skyline to aspire to the model of Shanghai rather than Manhattan. How much is the jaw dropping scale of the capital\u2019s once in a century transformation the product of the imposition of a single guiding vision, or would it have taken place without it?<\/p>\n<p>London has tended to shrug off attempts to tame and direct its growth ever since its townsfolk ignored the attempts of Tudor monarchs to prevent the growth of suburbs outside its city walls, and its refusal to accept Christopher Wren\u2019s masterplan for its reconstruction after the Great Fire of 1666. Its rush westward was given a massive, and entirely unintended boost by the random creation of a heavy bomber aerodrome at Heathrow that later became Europe\u2019s largest airport. And the Great Lurch East of the 1990s, represented by the eruption of the Canary Wharf financial centre from the site of a derelict banana warehouse was equally accidental. It was the product of the market taking ruthless advantage of a set of tax incentives and planning relaxations, intended to have a quite different effect and encourage the growth of small business in the area.<\/p>\n<p>If one believes that London is a gently anarchic city that has always grown haphazardly in fits and starts, and it is that quality that is behind its long-term robust good health, then the interventionism proposed by Livingstone is either irrelevant, or even counterproductive. In fact, the Mayor has produced a blueprint for future development that is as prescriptive as anything London has seen. It remains to be seen how effective it will be. Certainly London has had large-scale urban visions in the past. It was Nash\u2019s London that was heroic enough to inspire Napoleon III to remodel Paris, just as it was the London Underground that used to set the pace for the Paris Metro. The Barbican, London Wall and Paternoster Square were all the product of carefully considered planning strategies, at least two of which have subsequently been expunged.<\/p>\n<p>But in the last quarter of a century, London has got out of the habit of seeing that such strategies are possible, which is what makes Livingstone\u2019s blueprints for physical and transport policy seem so strikingly different from what has gone before. For London, it is the legacy issues that are really what the Olympics are all about. Learning from Barcelona\u2019s experiences, Livingstone is planning to use the games for the catalytic effect that they will have on London\u2019s bleak eastern fringes. The Olympics will be focussed on Newham and Stratford to help kick start London\u2019s eastward growth, in the attempt to find somewhere to put the extra 800,000 Londoners that Livingstone is predicting will need to be housed in the next two decades.<\/p>\n<p>Development will be concentrated on Stratford, which will get the stadium, the pool, an aerodrome, hockey stadium and four indoor arena, and the 17,000 bed Olympic Village; the Lower Lea Valley that will be the site of the smaller venues. The scale of the project is massive, and will see what amounts to the total reengineering of East London. Depending on how you count the cost, it could be anything from \u00a32 to \u00a34 billion, once the games have ended and everything has been tidied up. As far as transport is concerned, the flagship will be the Olympic Javelin, a high-speed shuttle running on the cross channel rail track from St. Pancras to the Olympic stadium in just ten minutes. There are promises for an expansion of the East London line, the Docklands Light Railway and the North London Line, but not as yet any clear commitments from the government about the future of Crossrail.<\/p>\n<p>Nor are these the only major developments underway in the city. The area around King\u2019s Cross is just beginning to take in the scale of the transformation that is about to overtake it. The new St. Pancras station, designed to handle traffic on the high-speed link to Paris and Brussels through the channel, is just the first step. The huge glass and white steel box awkwardly tacked onto the back of Victorian St. Pancras will soon form just part of a sprawling development on the site of the railway and canal lands. As one developer labours on a masterplan for a project that will match Canary Wharf in its scale, another has already opportunistically swooped in to take advantage of the possibilities offered by a shift in perceptions of the area that is already taking place. This is no longer an area dominated by the drug and sex trade. The Guardian newspaper will be moving into offices here. At White City, a gap in the city\u2019s fabric for most of a century is being filled in by a giant shopping complex. South of the Thames, at Elephant &amp; Castle, the comprehensive approach to planning of the 1960s is being unpicked on a massive scale.<\/p>\n<p>This is a shift that is producing qualitative as well as quantitative changes. For the rest of the world it provides a unique opportunity to see the tensions and fault lines between planning and market forces, between a centralised vision and laissez-faire. For Londoners it\u2019s a giddying, dizzying ride, which once more puts it in the uncertain territory of a metropolis in the midst of the kind of change it has not seen for a century.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":null,"article_publishing_date":"November 2005","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"1","name":"Deyan","created":"2011-08-23 13:50:55","modified":"2013-10-23 12:14:25","slug":"sudjic-deyan","family_name":"Sudjic","title":"","email_address":"","photo_legacy":"\/0_images\/02-DSudjic.jpg","profile_text":"<p>Deyan Sudjic is the Director of the Design Museum in London.

The neighbourhoods around Clerkenwell and Shoreditch form the core of this cluster, with the Old Street roundabout \u2013 also called &#8216;Silicon Roundabout&#8217; \u2013 at its heart. Since 2010, the Coalition Government has led a high-profile drive to accelerate its economic development \u2013 the &#8216;Tech City&#8217; initiative. Launching the strategy in November 2010, and drawing heavily on the imagery of Silicon Valley, David Cameron set out an ambitious agenda to develop Inner East London into \u2018one of the world\u2019s great technology centres\u2019<a class=\"cite_ref\" id=\"cite_ref-1\" href=\"#cite_note-1\">1<\/a>. By March 2012, George Osborne was hailing Tech City as central to the UK Government&#8217;s industrial strategy<a class=\"cite_ref\" id=\"cite_ref-2\" href=\"#cite_note-2\">2<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Ministers are right to get excited. Inner East London plays an important role in the capital&#8217;s digital ecosystem. In recent research that I led for the Centre for London (CFL)<a class=\"cite_ref\" id=\"cite_ref-3\" href=\"#cite_note-3\">3<\/a> we found that on a broad count, the cluster contained over 3,200 digital economy firms in 2010 \u2013 double the count of 1997. That business base is particularly strong on digital content industries, and now includes global players like MindCandy, Unruly, Songkick and Last.fm. The area also contains over 48,500 digital economy jobs, increasing its share of London\u2019s tech employment by a third since 1997 \u2013 and in 2010 it continued to gain jobs while digital economy employment in the rest of the city fell. <\/p>\n<p>With the area approaching critical mass, policy and industry voices are starting to think about the next phase of Inner East London&#8217;s digital evolution \u2013 a corporate invasion? 3D printing, and a revival of manufacturing? This article explores a third scenario \u2013 the development of a smarter, greener core. The area has been quietly hatching a number of &#8216;cleanweb&#8217; firms, and has the beginnings of a green ecosystem, with networks, meetups and accelerators in place. Over the past year, angels and venture capital (VC) players have been picking up interest. But as with London&#8217;s wider digital economy, there are real challenges ahead. <\/p>\n<h1>Smart city, clean tech, cleanweb<\/h1>\n<p>Terminology matters here. Precise definitions of the &#8216;smart city&#8217; are elusive, as LSE&#8217;s Ayesha Khanna points out. For some it&#8217;s a city that uses advanced technologies to manage energy, lighting and transport infrastructures more efficiently. For others it&#8217;s a city that places the minimum demands on the environment. In practice, it&#8217;s probably both. Certainly, the smart city agenda is driven by the diffusion of new digital technologies and systems (broadband and mobile broadband, cloud computing, big data and the social web). It&#8217;s also driven by urbanisation and by the challenges of updating and retrofitting urban infrastructures, and by policymakers&#8217; increasing awareness of limits on current economic development paths. As the world develops more cities, especially in the Global South, we need to find more efficient and more sustainable ways to help them run.  <\/p>\n<p>We also need a sense of the smart city product space. Paul Miller, of Bethnal Green Ventures, talks about &#8216;cleantech and cleanweb&#8217;. Cleantech is the physical green economy \u2013 involving electric and driverless cars, smart grids, smart meters, PV cells. Cleanweb is online technology for information and organisation \u2013 crowd-sensing apps and maps, environmental information, online marketplaces. These aren&#8217;t always wholly distinct: US firm SolarCity, for instance, offers design, installation, finance and online monitoring of domestic solar energy systems. <\/p>\n<p>On the ground, two very different versions of the smart city are appearing. Carlo Ratti and Anthony Townsend dub these &#8216;top down&#8217; and &#8216;bottom up&#8217;<a class=\"cite_ref\" id=\"cite_ref-4\" href=\"#cite_note-4\">4<\/a>. Top down smart cities are masterplanned demonstration projects \u2013 think Masdar in Abu Dhabi, or Cisco&#8217;s &#8216;city in a box&#8217; in Songdo, South Korea. Bottom up smart cities are messier, more complex, building and retrofitting new services on top of existing social media networks and technological infrastructures. For a city like London, it&#8217;s this social, citizen-powered approach that&#8217;s most likely to take off. London faces multiple challenges: a growing population, overloaded transport systems and an energy-inefficient housing stock. But it is also developing smarter systems \u2013 such as  the congestion charge, the Oystercard and \u2018Boris Bikes\u2019 \u2013 which offer  glimpses of how a smarter capital might work in the future. <\/p>\n<p>Cleanweb products and services, which focus on making existing infrastructures work better, are particularly attractive for London policymakers. And London&#8217;s digital businesses, with their strengths in web design, apps and digital content, are well placed to develop new tools and ideas. <\/p>\n<h1>Going green in East London<\/h1>\n<p>Over the past five years, a green layer has gradually developed in the East London digital scene. These firms are mostly very small and very young, and are operating in both cleanweb and social smart city product space. Some offer online apps and tools \u2013 such as Carbon Culture<a class=\"cite_ref\" id=\"cite_ref-5\" href=\"#cite_note-5\">5<\/a> (a community platform to engage people in saving energy), Gnergy<a class=\"cite_ref\" id=\"cite_ref-6\" href=\"#cite_note-6\">6<\/a> (web apps to assess and improve energy performance) or Pad Partners<a class=\"cite_ref\" id=\"cite_ref-7\" href=\"#cite_note-7\">7<\/a> (using social networks to source home energy efficiency advice). Others have developed green transport marketplaces, like Carbon Voyage<a class=\"cite_ref\" id=\"cite_ref-8\" href=\"#cite_note-8\">8<\/a> (online car sharing and journey matching) and Loco2 (pan-European train booking). A third group are more focused on hardware and systems, such as Cosm<a class=\"cite_ref\" id=\"cite_ref-9\" href=\"#cite_note-9\">9<\/a> (a platform to connect smart devices like energy monitors), Fairphone<a class=\"cite_ref\" id=\"cite_ref-10\" href=\"#cite_note-10\">10<\/a> (an ethical mobile) and Mastadon C<a class=\"cite_ref\" id=\"cite_ref-11\" href=\"#cite_note-11\">11<\/a> (greener cloud computing, which sends work to the most energy-efficient location). <\/p>\n<p>Amee<a class=\"cite_ref\" id=\"cite_ref-12\" href=\"#cite_note-12\">12<\/a> is, arguably, the daddy of East London&#8217;s cleanweb scene. Founded five years ago, the firm now has 13 staff and offices in London and San Francisco. Amee offers a combination of aggregated environmental information, carbon\/energy audits and data\/tech management consultancy services. Amee was the first of the scene&#8217;s cleanweb firms to get major VC investment, and is now helping to seed the next generation: founder and chairman Gavin Starks is now Chief Executive of the Open Data Institute, and Amee alumni are involved in the London Cleanweb network \u2013 &#8216;because we don&#8217;t want to bluescreen the planet&#8217; \u2013 which organises meetups, talks and hack days<a class=\"cite_ref\" id=\"cite_ref-13\" href=\"#cite_note-13\">13<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Such social infrastructure is an important part of the local ecosystem for young firms.  Bethnal Green Ventures (BGV) is another<a class=\"cite_ref\" id=\"cite_ref-14\" href=\"#cite_note-14\">14<\/a>. An accelerator for social\/environmental start-ups, BGV offers a combination of seed funding (GB\u00a315,000 \/ US$23,877 per firm), a peer group, structured networking and mentoring, as well as shared workspace at Google Campus. BGV is increasingly in demand \u2013 working with six firms at a time, the group interviewed 50 candidates for its latest cohort, and expects to see more in the next round. <\/p>\n<p>BGV&#8217;s Paul Miller notes rising angel and VC interest over the past 12 months. The Tech City initiative has shone a bright light on the area; more importantly, variable experiences with cleantech investments have pushed many US investors towards cleanweb, where capital requirements are lower and returns potentially higher. <\/p>\n<h1>The future<\/h1>\n<p>So what next for East London&#8217;s nascent green economy scene? London&#8217;s cleanweb firms feel well positioned. Their great shared asset is the collective knowledge and resources of the wider urban digital economy. Cleanweb activity in particular builds on London firms&#8217; skills in programming and digital content \u2013 perhaps more than physical engineering. As far as East London goes, cleanweb goes with the grain. <\/p>\n<p>The next few years won&#8217;t be easy, however. Many of the challenges are common to all digital start-ups: the CFL research identified problems around skills, finance, workspace, connectivity and mentoring that may prevent firms growing to scale.  Even so, green digital economy firms may have it harder than others.   <\/p>\n<p>One challenge is reaching paying customers, both in the UK and abroad. Gavin Starks notes that &#8216;the main challenge is making environmental issues carry enough financial weight to be relevant to businesses.&#8217; Paul Miller suggests a wider British cultural aversion to &#8216;buying things off start-ups&#8217; \u2013 shared across public and private sectors. <\/p>\n<p>Accessing finance is another issue. CFL found a number of companies bootstrapping, or relying on family and friends. Those who had approached angels or VC for equity had often had disappointing experiences \u2013 many providers lack knowledge of digital sectors and are often very risk-averse, problems compounded by VC firms&#8217; lack of physical presence in \u2013 and thus knowledge of \u2013 the area. These issues are amplified for very novel technologies like cleanweb (Amee, notably, got its first VC money from New York and the South Bay). These constraints may ease in the years to come, as more US investors arrive and specialised VC and boutique operations like Passion Capital, Amadeus and Seedcamp step up operations. The UK\u2019s Technology Strategy Board is also helping out, with GB\u00a31.25m (US$1.99m) on the table for innovative energy-efficient computing ideas and \u00a31m (US$1.59m) for energy harvesting technologies. <\/p>\n<p>A third challenge will be the continued supply of physical workspace. Shoreditch and Clerkenwell are dense urban areas, with limited space for new building. Tech City has brought welcome attention, but is also contributing to rising property costs. Many policymakers hope that digital firms will migrate to brand new spaces in the Olympic Park, Stratford City and the Royal Docks. The iCity development, on the former Olympic Broadcast and Media Centre, is hoping to attract a mix of major players and start-ups. Siemens&#8217; The Crystal exhibition centre is intended to kick-start a Green Enterprise District. No doubt some firms will head further East, but many have little interest in doing so. At present, there are certainly few obvious connections between the grassroots cleanweb scene around Shoreditch, and shiny new buildings further East.    <\/p>\n<p>A fourth big issue is the policy environment. As with many frontier technologies, this kind of activity needs government support \u2013 through legislation, enabling frameworks and funding tools. National and local government are both actively focused on the digital economy, although the strategy and policy mix can be improved (see the CFL study for more on this). For cleantech and cleanweb firms, the wider policy environment is also key. The lack of certainty on flagship UK initiatives like the Green Deal, for example, makes life harder for nascent providers, as do ongoing rows about support for renewables. And the failure of the Copenhagen climate negotiations has knocked substantial sums off firm valuations. <\/p>\n<p>Finally, we need to consider the bigger picture. Smart city optimists suggest a new electric age for cities is beginning to appear. As Carlota Perez would put it, cleantech and cleanweb technologies have already arrived, and the next two decades will see a &#8216;deployment period&#8217;, as they become embedded in urban structures<a class=\"cite_ref\" id=\"cite_ref-15\" href=\"#cite_note-15\">15<\/a>. Pessimists, like Robert Gordon or Tyler Cowen, suggest we&#8217;ve already wrung the maximum innovative potential out of the Internet, and those gains have been relatively small<a class=\"cite_ref\" id=\"cite_ref-16\" href=\"#cite_note-16\">16<\/a>. My personal view is that there&#8217;s still great potential for the diffusion of new technologies into smart city products and services. It&#8217;s certainly one plausible \u2013 and encouraging \u2013 possible future for East London&#8217;s vibrant digital economy.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"<p>The author would like to thank Charlie Allom, Mike Butcher, Andrew Campling, Maria Irurita, Paul Miller, Gavin Starks, Chris Stutz, James Swanston, Georgina Voss and TCIO for their input.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"cite_note\" id=\"cite_note-1\" href=\"#cite_ref-1\">1<\/a> Cameron, D.

The fact that it is one of the world\u2019s safest and most peaceful cities, in spite of its population of more than seven million\u2013who are densely packed into tight living spaces while also feeling the effects of the herculean forces of globalisation, swept by the cross currents of different cultures\u2013is already a miracle in itself. Conflicts, contradictions, contentions and confusion are all to be expected. Yet Hong Kong\u2019s happiness index has held up very well. Indeed it had risen from its trough of 67.2 in 2007 to 69.3 in 2008 \u2013 much to our surprise, since the 2008 survey was conducted after the global financial tsunami had already taken place. The index has since then hovered between 70 and 71 out of 100, not at all a bad reading. As it happens, Macau\u2019s happiness index, which was based on a questionnaire modified from the Lingnan survey, was found to be very close to that of Hong Kong.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0The Lingnan annual happiness index survey summary result is based on the response to one question: \u2018Taking everything together, if 5 is neutral, 0 is most unhappy, and 10 is most happy, how would you rate your own happiness?\u2019 The territory-wide index is calculated as the average score of all respondents multiplied by 10.<\/p>\n<p>The 11-point scale of subjective well-being used in our questionnaire follows the Cantril ladder and is also used in a well-known Gallup survey. Because the scale 0 to 10 is familiar to people, and 5 provides a mid-point, thus not forcing people to make an unintended non-neutral report of subjective well-being, and because it potentially provides far more variation in the number reported than, say, a 5-point scale or a 7-point scale, this scale is preferred. Regression analyses using the reported measures have turned up interesting and consistent results, lending credence to the measure.<\/p>\n<p>In \u2018Hong Kong\u2019s Happiness Indices: What they tell us about LIFE\u2019 (2011), I attribute the resilience of Hong Kong\u2019s happiness index to the transformation of values and priorities among Hong Kong\u2019s population. The \u2018LIFE\u2019 scores (love, insight, fortitude and engagement) of Hong Kong\u2019s inhabitants indicate that since 2008 they have become more caring, wiser, more resilient and more active. LIFE scores have been found to be very significant in explaining the reported happiness of people.<\/p>\n<p>While the mind-set of people is crucial in determining their happiness, government policy and circumstances also play a role. Hong Kong\u2019s population is very keen on maintaining the rule of law. The city\u2019s inhabitants are worried about whether they can sustain their living standards after retirement, and about the cost and availability of health care. Some are concerned about the cost of their children\u2019s education; while others are anxious that their offspring may fall in with the wrong crowd. Many have reported financial pressure, a factor which has been found to undermine happiness. Such pressure is also related to the kind of housing in which respondents are accommodated. Thus effectively providing public housing and a reliable and affordable health care system will significantly boost happiness.<\/p>\n<p>Interestingly, and perhaps surprisingly, Hong Kong\u2019s land policy has not only contributed to the city\u2019s high housing cost but also led to higher income disparity, and a more narrowly based \u2013 as opposed to a more diversified \u2013 economy.<\/p>\n<p>Consider the fact that only 7 per cent of Hong Kong\u2019s 1,068 square kilometres (412 square miles) is devoted to housing, while only 2.7 per cent of Hong Kong\u2019s land is currently devoted to commercial and industrial uses. Hong Kong is known as a financial and commercial centre, but it devotes far more land to agriculture (6.1 per cent) than to finance and commerce (a mere 0.4 per cent)! The paucity of land devoted to economic activities implies very high land rent, and the high cost of land effectively prices many activities out of the economy. In other words, if the cost of land had been lower, Hong Kong\u2019s economy would probably have been more diversified. Many more home-grown and smaller enterprises could have existed, providing more employment opportunities to Hong Kong\u2019s labour force, and potentially boosting wage levels. Lower land costs would also have reduced the fortunes of the land-rich class, thus narrowing the income gap between the rich and the poor.<\/p>\n<p>To suggest releasing more land is easy, but from where would such land be obtained? Logically, land that is ripe for economic development must be accessible, and thanks to the construction of the West Rail, and the extension of railways in other parts of the territory, many possibilities have now opened up. Much of the land around Kam Sheung Road and Yuen Long, for example, is eminently developable.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>It is a pity that the SAR Government has chosen to house its headquarters in a prime, harbour-side site in Tamar in Central. It is a massive building and even though some government functions probably need to be so centrally located, many other departments do not. The SAR Government really should have taken the lead in locating more of its offices in other parts of the city.<\/p>\n<p>Given the rising concern over preservation and conservation, releasing more land for development is bound to meet with resistance. The Country Park Ordinance, for example, still preserves the same area of Hong Kong\u2019s countryside today as it did in 1976, while the city\u2019s population had grown from little more than four million to more than seven million in that time. We certainly need to be concerned about preservation and conservation, but we must also consider Hong Kong\u2019s needs in housing, in commerce and in community uses. In principle, at the margin, the benefit of a hectare of land preserved should be equal to the benefit of a hectare of land developed. In short, policy-makers must understand that only a comparison of overall social costs and social benefits should determine how much land is to be devoted for one purpose as opposed to another.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>By the same token, the government must use the same cost-benefit metrics to determine if it should increase any item of government expenditure. That is why stating that government expenditures must be no more than 20 per cent of the GDP under the dictum of \u2018big market, small government\u2019 really does not make sense. But clearly the presumption that fiscal policy should be sustainable is entirely correct. Hong Kong must not take the route of many democratic countries, which cater to voters\u2019 short-term benefits at the expense of fiscal sustainability.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Policies that aim at promoting happiness must further the \u2018public interest\u2019. In <em>Public Policy and the Public Interest<\/em> (forthcoming) I define the public interest as \u2018the ex-ante welfare of the representative individual facing a public policy choice\u2019. The \u2018representative individual\u2019 is a hypothetical person who has no memory of his own identity and who ponders over what would happen to him under a proposed policy, assuming that he could be anyone in society and therefore could both benefit from and be damaged by it. Thus the representative individual has no vested interest in the impending decision. He is completely impartial. He puts himself into the shoes of every person in considering a policy. If, in taking such an impartial position, we conclude that a policy is good, then the policy is said to promote the public interest.<\/p>\n<p>This may sound a little abstract, but it will be a lot clearer if we consider a numerical example. Suppose a serious disease befalls one Hong Kong citizen once a year. Suppose it takes HK$ 7 million (US$ 900,150) to treat it, and that the treatment is entirely successful. The representative individual approach would allow us to conclude that, beyond doubt, the treatment should be publicly funded. If each of us has the probability of 1\/7 million in each year to contract the disease, and the government decides that it will not fund the treatment, we will be living in fear. If the government chooses to fund it, the cost is a mere HK$1 (US 12 cents) per year for each of its citizens. The cost is next to nothing, but the benefit, in terms of the peace of mind generated, is certainly much greater.<\/p>\n<p>Some might argue that the private insurance market should take care of this, but this is just one well-defined misfortune. In practice, there are so many kinds of misfortunes that could happen, we really cannot expect the private insurance market to take care of all of them. While private insurance is certainly to be encouraged, a social safety net that takes care of people hit by different kinds of misfortunes, while featuring designs that guard against the more obvious forms of moral hazard, will give all of us a greater peace of mind and thus more happiness.<\/p>\n<p>Readers will realise that this approach is related to John Rawls, who, in his <em>Theory of Justice <\/em>(1971), proposed the \u2018veil of ignorance\u2019 thought experiment. Actually the ex-ante approach can be traced to John Stuart Mill in the eighteenth century. Interestingly, and remarkably, Laozi, more than 2,000 years ago, implored the decision-makers for society to consider the situation of everyone in society. Verse 49 from the Daodejing reads: \u2018The Sages do not have a fixed mind different from that of others. They take the mind of any of their peoples as their own mind.\u2019<\/p>\n<p>Rawls is associated with the maximin principle: maximising the welfare of the person with minimum welfare. I agree with Professor Yew-Kwang Ng of Monash University that this position is probably too extreme, even though the Rawlsian concern about the plight of the most unfortunate is well justified, not so much exclusively but along with consideration about the benefits and costs that may go to others. The best preferred policy ex ante does not have to be the maximin, but should certainly reflect the weight of discomfort experienced by those who are most adversely affected.<\/p>\n<p>Hong Kong is one of the safest cities on earth, and has the potential to be one of the happiest. A better understanding of the meaning of public interest will go a long way to resolving some of its conflicts, such as finding the sites for \u2018not in my backyard\u2019 or \u2018locally unwanted land use\u2019 facilities. If we are considerate, we would offer to compensate those in those localities who might be adversely affected and go the extra mile by reducing the undesirable side-effects of such facilities. Hong Kong needs that extra consideration to build more trust, and in building more trust we will have stronger social capital to build a happier Hong Kong. Diener et al. have argued that information and analyses on subjective well-being should inform public policy. With such awareness and an awareness of the meaning of the public interest, policy-makers will have a better chance to promote happiness.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/11\/2011_chw_3040_Ho.pdf","article_publishing_date":"November 2011","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"109","name":"Lok Sang","created":"2011-11-04 10:01:47","modified":"2011-11-22 12:44:31","slug":null,"family_name":"Ho","title":null,"email_address":null,"photo_legacy":null,"profile_text":null,"organization":null,"role":null,"additional_affiliations":null,"qualifications":null,"staff_pages_blurb":null,"office_location":null,"display_after":null,"display_until":null,"extended_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb_lang2":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation_lang2":null,"phone_number":null}],"attachments":false,"gallery":{"slug":false,"extra_classes":"","slides":[]}},{"request_language":"","current_page_uri":"\/media\/search-dev.json","lang2_slug":false,"lang2_name":false,"parent_publication_id":19,"featured_image_uri":"","article_title":"Mapping Health Outcomes","permalink":"mapping-health-outcomes","article_subtitle":null,"article_abstract":"","article_summary":"","article_text":"<h3>Child mortality<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"\/files\/2011\/11\/CHW_R232_ChildM_map-01-01-01-s.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-919\" title=\"CHW_R232_ChildM_map-01-01-01-s\" src=\"\/files\/2011\/11\/CHW_R232_ChildM_map-01-01-01-s.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1893\" height=\"1283\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Child and infant mortality are two of the most frequently used indicators to assess health performance internationally. In this regard, Hong Kong has achieved substantial improvements over the past 30 years, as is clear from the line chart on the near right. Child mortality (death before a child\u2019s fifth birthday, and here migration-adjusted) has decreased from 13 in 1980 to less than four deaths per 1,000 live births in 2009. Infant mortality is also at a very low level, at two deaths per 1,000 live births, compared to five in London and New York, 13 in Mexico City. Improvements have been made in all parts of the urban region with little overall spatial variation in levels of child mortality. Where they do occur, however, high child mortality rates are spatially concentrated in particular parts of the New Territories, where they are between 17 and 35 deaths per 1,000 live births, similar to the 33 deaths per 1,000 live births in Johannesburg. While rates are found to be considerably higher in peripheral locations in Hong Kong, it should be borne in mind that the number of births among Hong Kong residents in some of these areas is also extremely low, which is likely to make these statistics prone to greater annual fluctuation. The strong relationship between deprivation and child mortality is revealed by the bar chart on the far right, which indicates that locations of high child mortality are overwhelmingly likely to be those of high deprivation. In Hong Kong\u2019s most deprived areas, child mortality rates are more than 1.5 times the city figure.<\/p>\n<div>\n<h4>Improving life chances<\/h4>\n<p><a href=\"\/files\/2011\/11\/2011_chw_3090_01-01.gif\" rel=\"lightbox\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-974\" title=\"2011_chw_3090_01-01\" src=\"\/files\/2011\/11\/2011_chw_3090_01-01.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"960\" height=\"960\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h4>Linking health and deprivation<\/h4>\n<p><a href=\"\/files\/2011\/11\/2011_chw_3090_01-02.gif\" rel=\"lightbox\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-975\" title=\"2011_chw_3090_01-02\" src=\"\/files\/2011\/11\/2011_chw_3090_01-02.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"960\" height=\"960\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p><em>Mortality figures are migration-adjusted, that is, records of residents living outside Hong Kong have been excluded.

It is often used as an estimation of health status, as well as to calculate \u2018years of potential life lost\u2019. In Hong Kong, premature mortality is extremely low by international standards, at 216 deaths per 100,000 people (but it is measured differently in different countries). This strong performance conceals a significant gender divide: the premature mortality rate is twice as high for men (305 deaths per 100,000 people) as it is for women (134 deaths per 100,000 population). While a gender gap is common throughout the world, the ratio between men and women\u2019s premature mortality has widened in Hong Kong from around 1.5 to 2.3 since 1981.<br \/> Premature mortality also varies significantly across Hong Kong. Interestingly, there is no clear pattern visible between Hong Kong Island, Kowloon and the New Territories but, as in the case of child mortality, significant differences are present at smaller scales, closely mirroring patterns of deprivation. Within Kowloon, Sham Shui Po, the northern part of Kowloon City and Whampoa display significant differences. Overall, premature mortality varies significantly from 113 deaths per 100,000 people in the poorest 20 per cent of areas to 65 deaths per 100,000 people in the wealthiest 20 per cent of areas. Pre-mature mortality is higher in high-density quintiles (45,000 people per square kilometre or more) and lower in the lowest-density quintile (up to 4,000 people per square kilometre). It is lowest of all in the density band of between 4,000 to 17,000 people per square kilometre (second quintile) \u2013 the density band that also happens to include privileged areas most often.<\/p>\n<div>\n<h4>Mortality and deprivation<\/h4>\n<p><a href=\"\/files\/2011\/11\/2011_chw_3090_02-01.gif\" rel=\"lightbox\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-976\" title=\"2011_chw_3090_02-01\" src=\"\/files\/2011\/11\/2011_chw_3090_02-01.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"960\" height=\"960\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h4>Linking health and density<\/h4>\n<p><a href=\"\/files\/2011\/11\/2011_chw_3090_02-02.gif\" rel=\"lightbox\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-977\" title=\"2011_chw_3090_02-02\" src=\"\/files\/2011\/11\/2011_chw_3090_02-02.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"960\" height=\"960\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p><em>Mortality figures are migration-adjusted, that is, records of residents living outside Hong Kong have been excluded.

The Kowloon district of Sham Shui Po, home to comparatively deprived groups, borders the fairly wealthy north of Kowloon City district.<\/p>\n<p>Hong Kong\u2019s population is ageing. The \u2018Ageing society\u2019 chart shows that the proportion of the population over 65 has risen steadily over the last 30 years, and now stands at 12 per cent. Today, young people under 20 make up just 20 per cent of the population. The combination of Hong Kong\u2019s ageing population and an increasing trend of older people living alone mean that Hong Kong\u2019s population is becoming ever more vulnerable. This phenomenon is concentrated problem in Kowloon, Hong Kong Island and the central New Territories, where the share of single elderly households is greatest, as can be seen from the bar chart \u2018Vulnerable households\u2019.<\/p>\n<div>\n<p><a href=\"\/files\/2011\/11\/2011_chw_3080_01-01.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-970\" title=\"2011_chw_3080_01-01\" src=\"\/files\/2011\/11\/2011_chw_3080_01-01.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1016\" height=\"1016\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"\/files\/2011\/11\/2011_chw_3080_01-02.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-971\" title=\"2011_chw_3080_01-02\" src=\"\/files\/2011\/11\/2011_chw_3080_01-02.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1016\" height=\"1016\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<h3>Housing inequality<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"\/files\/2011\/11\/CHW_R231_InequalitiesMap-01-01-S.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-917\" title=\"CHW_R231_InequalitiesMap-01-01-S\" src=\"\/files\/2011\/11\/CHW_R231_InequalitiesMap-01-01-S.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1893\" height=\"1283\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Hong Kong\u2019s land regulation policies and high-density development has had significant impacts on the level of crowding amongst its housing stock. On average, a Hong Kong resident has 13 square metres (140 square feet) of living space available to them, a quantity that is an order of magnitude lower than those enjoyed by the residents of cities with similar levels of income such as London or even New York. The number of rooms per person across the city \u2013 a proxy for overcrowding \u2013 suggests an unequal spatial pattern that closely mirrors the distribution in income and housing tenure. In the dense central areas of Hong Kong Island, for example, the number of rooms per person is higher where the population is richer. As one might expect, ownership rates in such areas are also significantly higher: almost 60 per cent of households living on Hong Kong Island own their property, while this share is significantly lower in parts of the urban region where there are more deprived neighbourhoods, such as in Kowloon and central New Territories.<\/p>\n<p>Public housing makes up 31 per cent of the overall housing stock in Hong Kong, thanks to government\u2019s substantial housing programmes. This is much higher in Kowloon and the southern parts of the New Territories than in Hong Kong Island, as a result of the decision to deliver the majority of public housing through the creation of new towns. While low income is one important social factor in determining vulnerability in relation to health, living in poor housing conditions adds another important burden, and one which is disproportionately felt by low income residents.<\/p>\n<div>\n<p><a href=\"\/files\/2011\/11\/2011_chw_3080_02-01.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-972\" title=\"2011_chw_3080_02-01\" src=\"\/files\/2011\/11\/2011_chw_3080_02-01.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1016\" height=\"1016\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"\/files\/2011\/11\/2011_chw_3080_02-02.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-973\" title=\"2011_chw_3080_02-02\" src=\"\/files\/2011\/11\/2011_chw_3080_02-02.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1016\" height=\"1016\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p>Source: Hong Kong Census and Statistics Department, Hong Kong Planning Department.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":null,"article_publishing_date":"November 2011","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"85","name":"Jens","created":"2011-10-28 11:06:01","modified":"2013-09-17 08:35:32","slug":"kandt-jens","family_name":"Kandt","title":"","email_address":"j.kandt@lse.ac.uk","photo_legacy":"","profile_text":"","organization":"LSE Cities, London School of Economics and Political Science","role":"Researcher","additional_affiliations":"","qualifications":"","staff_pages_blurb":"<p>Jens Kandt is a researcher at LSE Cities where he focusses on the application of quantitative methods, including survey design and spatial analysis for urban geographical research.

The flood showed the worst and the best of the city. Hundreds of people drowned. But unlike the situation after Katrina hit New Orleans, there was no widespread breakdown of civic order; even though the police were absent, the crime rate did not go up. That was because Mumbaikers were busy helping each other. Slum-dwellers went to the motorway and took stranded motorists into their homes and made room for one more person in shacks, where the average occupancy is seven adults to a room. Volunteers waded through waist-deep water to bring food to the 150,000 people stranded in train stations. Human chains were formed to get people out of the floods. Most of the government machinery was absent, but nobody expected otherwise. Mumbaikers helped each other, because they had lost faith in the government helping them. On a planet of city dwellers, this is how most human beings are going to live and cope in the twenty-first century.<\/p>\n<p>At 15 million people within its municipal limits, Mumbai is the biggest, fastest, richest city in India, a city simultaneously experiencing a boom and a civic emergency; an island-state of hope in a very old country. Because of the reach of Bollywood movies, Mumbai is also a mass dream for the peoples of India. If you take a walk around Mumbai you\u2019ll see that everything \u2013 sex, death, trade, religion \u2013 are lived out on the pavement. It is a maximum city, maximum in its exigencies, maximum in its heart.<\/p>\n<p>Why do people still live in Mumbai? Every day is an assault on the individual\u2019s senses, from the time you get up, to the transport you take to go to work, to the offices you work in, to the forms of entertainment you are subjected to. The exhaust is so thick the air boils like a soup. There are too many people touching you, in the trains, in the lifts, when you go home to sleep. You live in a seaside city, but the only time most people get anywhere near the sea is for an hour on Sunday evening on a filthy beach. It doesn\u2019t stop when you\u2019re asleep either, for the night brings the mosquitoes out of the malarial swamps, the thugs of the underworld to your door, and the booming loudspeakers of the parties of the rich and the festivals of the poor. Why would you want to leave your brick house in the village with its two mango trees and its view of small hills in the East to come here?<\/p>\n<p>So that someday your eldest son can buy two rooms in Mira Road, at the northern edges of the city. And the younger one can move beyond that, to New Jersey. Your discomfort is an investment. Like ant colonies, people here will easily sacrifice their temporary pleasures for the greater progress of the family. One brother will work and support all the others, and he will gain a deep satisfaction from the fact that his nephew is taking an interest in computers and will probably go on to America. Mumbai functions on such invisible networks of assistance. In a Mumbai slum, there is no individual, there is only the organism. There are circles of fealty and duty within the organism, but the smallest circle is the family. There is no circle around the self.<\/p>\n<p>India frustrates description because everything you can say about it is true and false simultaneously. Yes, it could soon have the world\u2019s largest middle class. But it now has the world\u2019s largest underclass. And so with Mumbai. Everything is expanding exponentially: the call centres, the global reach of its film industry, its status as the financial gateway to India; as well as the slums, the numbers of absolutely destitute, the degradation of its infrastructure. The city\u2019s planners have their eyes set firmly on Shanghai, as a model for Mumbai. The government approved a McKinsey-drafted document titled \u2018Vision Mumbai\u2019, which aims to turn Mumbai into \u2018a world-class city by 2013\u2019. As the architect Charles Correa noted of the plan, \u2018There\u2019s very little vision. They\u2019re more like hallucinations.\u2019<\/p>\n<p>Mumbai needs to dramatically upgrade essential civic services: roads, sewers, transport, health, security. But, as one planner said to me, \u2018The nicer we make the city, the more the number of people that will come to live there\u2019. The greatest numbers of migrants to Mumbai now come from the impoverished North Indian states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Mumbai\u2019s problems cannot be solved until Bihar\u2019s problems are. You have to keep them down on the farm. And that means that agriculture has to become viable again for the small farmer. Abolishing trade-distorting subsidies in the United States and the EU would go a long way towards making, say, Indian cotton competitive with American cotton. Mumbai is at the mercy of national and international factors beyond its control.<\/p>\n<p>Then there are the steps that Indian governments could take. There is no reason Mumbai should be the capital of Maharashtra state. Shifting the state government to Navi Mumbai across the harbour, as was originally intended, would free up large amounts of space in the congested office district of Nariman Point. Beyond that, there has to be legislation establishing a strong executive authority for the city, with real decision-making power. The office of the mayor is currently no more than a figurehead; the city is run at the whim of the Chief Minister, and the state\u2019s interests are not necessarily those of the city. There are smart and brave architects and planners who are attempting to work with the state government. But they are trying to reason with people who come from the villages, who do not have a metropolitan sensibility. Mumbai needs a mayor with vision and political power to push through the enormous infrastructural projects that the city so badly needs. The city, which contributes 37 per cent of all the taxes paid in India, gets only a small fraction of it back from the central government in the form of subsidies.<\/p>\n<p>Land should be opened up in the south-eastern part of the island, much of which is occupied by a naval and commercial port. There is no reason Mumbai needs a naval home base, which could be relocated further down the coast. Efficient utilisation of the eastern docklands could also alleviate the pressure; the city needs schools, parks, auditoria, public spaces. Instead, it gets luxury housing and shopping malls. The example of the mill areas, in the centre of the city, where 2.43 km2 that were desperately needed for public use have instead been given over to developers, is a bad augury for the city.<\/p>\n<p>We all \u2013 wherever we live \u2013 have a stake in helping the people of megacities like Mumbai. The desperation of slum-dwellers in cities like Mumbai directly affects the economic fortunes of people in New York or Los Angeles. It\u2019s as important for London to understand Mumbai as it is for Mumbai to understand London, if for no other reason than that the next generation of Londoners is being born in Mumbai.<\/p>\n<p>So why do people still live in Mumbai? \u2018Mumbai is a bird of gold\u2019, a Muslim man in the Jogeshwari slum, whose brother was shot dead by the police in the riots, and who lives in a shack without running water or a toilet, told me. A Golden Songbird; try to catch it if you can. It flies quick and sly, and you\u2019ll have to work hard to catch it, but once it\u2019s in your hand, a fabulous fortune will open up for you. This is one reason why anyone would still want to come here, leaving the pleasant trees and open spaces of the village, braving the crime and the bad air and water. It is a place where your caste doesn\u2019t matter, where a woman can dine alone at a restaurant without being harassed, and where you can marry the person of your choice. For the young person in an Indian village, the call of Mumbai isn\u2019t just about money. It\u2019s also about freedom.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_159\" style=\"width: 1290px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-159\" src=\"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/10\/Chirodeep-Chaudhuri_Sunday-morning-in-the-chawls-at-Dadar.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"818\" \/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Of the millions traveling on Mumbai\u2019s 300 km long suburban rail system each day, close to 3,000 deaths per annum result from people crossing the rail line tracks or falling off the train.<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":null,"article_publishing_date":"November 2007","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"46","name":"Suketu","created":"2011-10-07 14:30:51","modified":"2013-10-23 10:08:41","slug":"mehta-suketu","family_name":"Mehta","title":"","email_address":"","photo_legacy":"","profile_text":"Suketu Mehta is the author of <em>Maximum City: Bombay Lost and Found<\/em>, which won the Kiriyama Prize and the Hutch Crossword Award, and was a finalist for the 2005 Pulitzer Prize.

In order to better understand the dynamics of health and well-being at the metropolitan level (rather than at the national level), LSE Cities has recalibrated available data for 129 urban areas. The map above shows how metropolitan regions perform in terms of health, indicating life expectancy figures where they are available, while the dataset on the facing page ranks the regions in order of performance across all three dimensions of development \u2013 health, education and wealth<\/p>\n<p>Given that most publically available data on health is not based at the official municipal or metropolitan level, the new LSE Cities index has been calculated using \u2018extended metropolitan regions\u2019 (EMR) to ensure a degree of geographical comparability across the sample of metropolitan areas (see p. 14) and their available datasets. To compensate for regional imbalances, each metropolitan area has been compared to its country\u2019s performance and \u2018pegged\u2019 against internationally comparable data at the national level. In relation to health scores, for example, most weight was given to life expectancy and infant mortality rate. When only one or neither of these was available, child immunisation rates or the number of doctors or hospital beds per person were taken into account. A full description of the methodology and data sources is available online.<\/p>\n<p>The data suggests that almost all of the 129 metropolitan regions analysed outperform their national contexts. Only 19 under-perform in health, ten in education and 14 in wealth. Metropolitan regions tend to outperform their national contexts most in the wealth dimension, followed by education and then health, but there is a considerable range of performances across all dimensions. The table on the adjacent page reveals that many regions in the sample do not score equally well on all three dimensions. High-income Asian and West European areas achieve their highest scores in health \u2013 with Hong Kong at the top \u2013 while Sydney and North American areas tend to score higher in education and wealth than in health. Chinese and Indian metropolitan regions tend to score much lower in education than they do in either health or wealth, while this trend is reversed in Sub-Saharan Africa, where the large majority score lowest in health. These patterns indicate that the level of performance of metropolitan regions is tightly linked to the level of development and welfare regime of the nation in which they exist.<\/p>\n<p>The map demonstrates how high-income Asian regions do better than all others (with a score of 0.87 out of 1 on average), while West European areas and Sydney come second (0.81), followed by their North American counterparts (0.76). Eastern European and Mexican metropolitan regions share a score of 0.65 on average, while those in China (0.61) score marginally higher than their South American peers (0.60). The lower end of the distribution is made up of North African and Middle-Eastern city regions (0.57 on average), South East Asia (0.55), South Asia cities (0.49) and, trailing even further behind, those in Sub-Saharan Africa (0.27).<\/p>\n<p>Despite these strong regional patterns, the data suggests that metropolitan regions with significantly different health scores exist in very close proximity to each other. The largest gap is in South America, between Santiago in Chile (0.76) and Bolivia\u2019s La Paz (0.47), followed by the difference between the high-scoring Hong Kong (0.88) and Singapore (0.86) and their respective neighbours, South Guangdong in mainland China (0.60) and Jakarta in Indonesia (0.58). Within the European continent there are wide discrepancies, with Stockholm in Sweden performing very well at 0.85 while Moscow in nearby Russia falls to 0.60, and relatively close cities like Athens and Istanbul score respectively 0.77 and 0.57. In Asia, even though Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam and Phnom Penh in Cambodia are only just over 200 kilometres (124 miles) apart, there is a substantial score difference of 0.22. Major variations also exist at the lower end of the scale in Africa, where Dar es Salaam in Tanzania fares twice as well as Lusaka in Zambia (0.36 versus 0.18) , while India\u2019s Chennai\u2019s outperforms Faisalabad in Pakistan, with a score of 0.57 compared to 0.41.<\/p>\n<p>The performance of a number of selected case studies is discussed in detail overleaf.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"\/files\/2011\/11\/Health-Education-and-Wealth-in-129-Metropolitan-Regions3.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-941\" title=\"Health, Education and Wealth in 129 Metropolitan Regions\" src=\"\/files\/2011\/11\/Health-Education-and-Wealth-in-129-Metropolitan-Regions3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2328\" height=\"3111\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"<p>Sources: UN Development Programme (2011).

From Cotonou in Benin, with just more than 1.5 million people, to the Tokyo metropolitan region, with more than 42 million inhabitants, our study both measures and illustrates density patterns in urban regions across all five continents, expanding LSE Cities\u2019 longstanding interest in the links between physical and social form. Using Google Earth satellite imagery, we captured a \u2018snapshot\u2019 of where people live and estimated \u2018net densities\u2019 by systematically tracing the built-up area of each metropolitan region \u2013 including central zones, satellite towns and the peripheral areas (a detailed methodology can be found online). The fact that 23 million people in Manila occupy a space one eighth the size of the same number of New Yorkers, or that Atlanta in the USA is 25 times larger than Hong Kong with roughly the same population, says something about the capacity and resilience of urban form as well as physical and geographical constraints.<\/p>\n<p>The map above shows the size of the extended metropolitan regions and their density, with darker blue indicating greater concentration of people and lighter blue more sparsely populated city regions. It shows that density levels vary significantly across and within world regions, with the highest densities concentrated in North Africa, the Middle East, South and South-east Asia and \u2013 not surprisingly \u2013 more sprawling cities in North America and Australia.<\/p>\n<p>To get a sense of the spatial dynamics of these city regions, we mapped 12 cases at the same scale with core built-up areas in black and peripheral areas in grey. By comparing the footprint of the world\u2019s largest urban conurbation in Tokyo with Atlanta, our sample\u2019s most land-hungry city region, we see that roughly the same amount of land is occupied by 42 million as by 7.5 million people. Meanwhile, the map of London shows that 14 million people are spread across South-east England.<\/p>\n<p>Some of the densest metropolitan regions in the world are illustrated opposite, arranged in three rows in descending order of density. Lahore, Hong Kong and Kinshasha \u2013 where more than nine million people live in 368 square kilometres (228 square miles) of single storey housing \u2013 reveal very diverse spatial patterns of hyper-density. Cairo, Manila and Bogot\u00e1 represent diverse African, Asian and South American typologies of average high density, while Lagos, Lima and Ho Chi Minh City accommodate radically different population sizes with similar levels of density.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"<p>Source: The population of the Extended Metropolitan Regions were based on national statistical sources and the UN World Urbanisation Prospects, 2009 Revision.

After a hiatus during the 1990s, brought on by the real estate bust early in the decade, major cities have responded to the pressures of the global economy by using very big, mixed-use developments as attractors of multinational business and sites for new housing. There is a striking physical similarity among the schemes, irrespective of the city in which they are located. At the same time they differ in social outcomes and planning processes, reflecting the level of commitment that the host city has towards social equity. The three to be discussed in this article are Atlantic Yards in Brooklyn, New York City; Stratford City and the larger Thames Gateway of which it forms a part, in London; and Amsterdam South (Zuidas).<\/p>\n<p>By the start of the new century all three cities had converted their economic base from heavy reliance on seaport and manufacturing activities to finance, business services, tourism, and creative industries. This transformation of function had forced a restructuring of spatial relations, resulting in the growth of office, entertainment, and luxury housing districts, as disused industrial and riverside structures were recycled, and glamorous new spaces, often designed by world-famous architects, became the hallmarks of economic success. In London and New York they form part of a more comprehensive planning process than in the recent past. In Amsterdam, where comprehensive planning has always reigned, there has been a rethinking of spatial strategies away from the compact city towards a polycentric model. All three cities must deal with escalating housing prices and have incorporated housing into the new projects, claiming the residential component as an equity measure. They differ, however, in the extent to which they intend to provide affordable units and to which physical and social goals are tied together.<\/p>\n<h2>Atlantic Yards, New York<\/h2>\n<p>The Atlantic Yards project forms part of a grand vision for New York presented by the Mayor\u2019s Office as PlaNYC2030. This document represents the first effort at a masterplan for the city since the John Lindsay mayoralty of the 1970s. To its credit, the plan emphasises development in all five boroughs of the city, promotes the creation of affordable housing, and calls for environmentally sensitive measures. But, while parts of it reflect sensitivity to neighbourhood concerns, its major projects utilise huge sums of public money and tax forgiveness for endeavours that radically transform their locations, stir up neighbourhood opposition, and threaten to sharpen the contrast between the haves and have-nots. The concerns of the plan are restricted to land use and development; it does not link these initiatives to education, job training and placement, or social services.<\/p>\n<p>The plan for Atlantic Yards did not originate within the city government, but instead was brought to it by a development firm, Forest City Ratner Companies (FCRC). FCRC had already built three large projects in downtown Brooklyn and was the principal developer working in that borough. Atlantic Yards, like the other mega-projects discussed in this essay, was the outcome of a public-private partnership. Unlike the others, it was going up in an area that already was densely inhabited, although the bulk of the project was being built over railway goods yards. Also different from the others, the project did not originate in a publicly sponsored plan, but instead was the consequence of a developer\u2019s initiative. The project, as it currently stands, reflects the form of developer-led planning that has characterised New York\u2019s construction projects since the 1970s, and the reluctance of the city and state to start projects unless a developer is already committed.<\/p>\n<h2>Thames Gateway, London<\/h2>\n<p>Unlike the mayors of New York and Amsterdam, the Mayor of London has little authority over the day-to-day management of the city. Thus, his principal focus is on strategic planning and transportation. In terms of the former, he must rely on the borough authorities and a bewildering array of development partnerships to implement his guidance. Both because of the pressures upon him to produce development and his desire to leave a mark on the city despite his limited powers, Ken Livingstone, the first Mayor of London after the creation of the Greater London Authority, put considerable energy into regeneration schemes. The anti-growth sentiments within the suburban areas that surround London in all directions but the East mean that the major thrust of new programmes is eastward. This is justified on the grounds that East London represents the most deprived part of the city, thereby standing to benefit most, and that it contains numerous underutilised sites.<\/p>\n<p>The eastward development of London has been labelled the Thames Gateway and billed as the largest development project in Europe. It extends 40 miles (64 kilometres) from Canary Wharf in the East End of London into the counties of Essex and Kent, covering 16 local authority districts. Goals set forth by the central government included 160,000 housing units, with 35 per cent classified as affordable; the creation of 180,000 new jobs; improvement in the skills levels of residents; access to high-quality health care, and 53,000 hectares (131,000 acres) of green space protected and enhanced.<sup>1<\/sup> The scheme involved both redevelopment of existing occupied or obsolete areas and growth on greenfield sites. In its London section it covered some extremely poor districts, while further out in the suburban counties it covered quite affluent settlements. The time frame involved was considerable \u2013 although the goals were ostensibly to be met by 2016, 40 years was a more realistic estimate for the entire Gateway. Construction, however, would be rapid within the western area where the Olympic Park and associated facilities were going up for the 2012 Games.<sup>2<\/sup> The overall objective was the development of \u2018sustainable communities\u2019 and a decentralisation of business activity from the present core in Westminster and the City of London.<\/p>\n<h2>Zuidas, Amsterdam South<\/h2>\n<p>In Amsterdam, as in London, planning and housing development nest within the context of planning guidelines and financial flows emanating from the national government. Considerable power, however, rests at the city level, where, because no single party dominates, consensus is the rule. There is less reliance on private for-profit developers for housing construction than in London and New York, and, as in London, the construction of social housing relies on the activities of non-profit housing associations. Amsterdam, however, resembles both London and New York in depending on private investment for office development and in requiring office developers to contribute public benefits in return for the right to build.<br \/>\nAmsterdam Zuidas involved the largest amount of office space of the developments discussed in this text. A number of the office blocks were already mostly built, not according to a plan, but opportunistically as a result of firms seeking convenient space outside the crowded city core. They went up with little relation of one to another. Many were bold architectural statements, but the area as a whole was incoherent, cold, and unfriendly to pedestrians. The ambitions of the planners were to retrofit an existing single-use area so as to create an urbane, multifunctional space. The challenge was particularly daunting because this district was divided by a multi-lane motorway and railroad tracks that, like the rail yards in Brooklyn, precluded pedestrian traffic and prevented design coherence. The proposed solution was extremely expensive \u2013 a 1.2-kilometre-long tunnel to accommodate both the road and railroad tracks. Amsterdam Zuidas was already the largest office development in the Netherlands with 248,600 m<sup>2<\/sup> (2.7 million square feet) built, or under construction. The national government envisioned it becoming an area that would allow Amsterdam to compete with Paris, Frankfurt, and Milan for global city functions. The municipality responded with a plan for the area due South of the centre that included housing, retail, educational and cultural facilities. However, only the office structures were built. Now the municipal government, with financial participation by the central government, was seeking to realise the vision of a multifunctional scheme. The project incorporated a larger role for the private sector in providing infrastructure than had previously characterised Dutch projects. The plan was to use the vehicle of a public-private partnership, with the very expensive covering of the rail and highway right-of-ways to be financed by the private sector. Sixty per cent of the costs would be borne by the private participants, who in return would receive development rights for one million m<sup>2<\/sup> (10.76 million square feet) in the newly created space. The public portion involved the city, provincial and national governments.<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>The mega-projects described here reflect the evolution of urban redevelopment programmes since their post-World War II beginnings. They also represent a convergence between American and European approaches to government intervention in the built environment as embodied in private-sector involvement and market orientation. At the same time, the European schemes, while incorporating a neo-liberal concern with competitiveness, manifest greater governmental direction and commitment to egalitarian goals.<\/p>\n<p>The contemporary mega-projects discussed here indicate that public-private partnerships can be a vehicle for the provision of public benefits, including job commitments, cultural facilities and affordable housing. They also show, however, that such projects are risky for both public and private participants, must primarily be oriented towards profitability, and typically produce a landscape dominated by bulky buildings that do not encourage urbanity, despite the claims of the projects\u2019 developers.<\/p>\n<p>In London and Amsterdam, where to some extent a social-democratic ethos still prevails, more is being asked from developers than is the case in New York. Also, the direct governmental contribution to housing is larger, because the national governments play a much larger role in financing affordable housing development. Even in these cities, however, everything depends on profitability of the market-driven parts of the project. There are only three forms of construction that can generate big profits: luxury residences and hotels, large-footprint office towers and shopping malls. Thus, what we can expect to see in both European and American cities are projects with similar design characteristics and product mixes, usually outside the old urban core and lacking the layering of old and new, small and big, that gives central cities their ambiance and opportunities. The requirements in all three projects for affordable housing and jobs represent a minimal commitment to socially just policies, but the primary orientation is to profitability and competitiveness. The extent to which the gains from increased competitiveness are spread throughout society depends on the size of the direct governmental commitment to public benefits. This is greatest in the Netherlands, where the welfare state, albeit shrunken, lives on. It is least in the United States, where the small size of national expenditures on housing and social welfare means that low-income people must depend almost wholly on trickle-down effects to gain from new development.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"<p>* This text was published previously in issue 783 of the <em>International Journal of Urban and Regional Research<\/em>, 2009.<\/p>\n<p><sup>1<\/sup> UK Department of Communities and Local Government, 2006.<br \/>\n<sup>2<\/sup> Editors\u2019 note: this essay was written before the completion of the Olympic Park in 2012.<\/p>\n","pdf_uri":"","article_publishing_date":"October 2013","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"412","name":"Susan S.","created":"2013-10-16 22:05:44","modified":"2013-10-16 22:05:44","slug":"fainstein-susan","family_name":"Fainstein","title":"","email_address":"","photo_legacy":"","profile_text":"","organization":"","role":"","additional_affiliations":"","qualifications":"","staff_pages_blurb":"","office_location":"","display_after":"","display_until":"","extended_blurb":"","special_2012ec_blurb":"","special_2012ec_affiliation":"","special_2013rio_blurb":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb_lang2":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation_lang2":null,"phone_number":null}],"attachments":false,"gallery":{"slug":false,"extra_classes":"","slides":[]}},{"request_language":"","current_page_uri":"\/media\/search-dev.json","lang2_slug":false,"lang2_name":false,"parent_publication_id":6,"featured_image_uri":"","article_title":"Mexico City: Housing and Neighbourhoods","permalink":"mexico-city-housing-and-neighbourhoods","article_subtitle":null,"article_abstract":"","article_summary":"","article_text":"<p>The rapidly growing Mexico City of the second half of the 20th century could not respond adequately to the mounting needs for housing and urban space. The sprawling and fragmented city that has come into being now faces the challenge to reintegrate the mosaic of segregated settlements and built typologies, to alleviate the still increasing housing shortage while at the same time controlling metropolitan expansion.<\/p>\n<p>In 2001, the Federal District\u2019s mayor addressed these issues through Bando Dos, a highly contested and fought over set of policy guidelines directed at the re-densification of the inner city and control of peripheral sprawl. Bando Dos promotes the construction of housing and commercial developments in the four central boroughs while putting a ceiling on the construction of new housing in the remaining twelve boroughs in the District. Between 2005 and 2006 more than 224 000 new residents will come to live in these four central boroughs in what has been the fastest development of housing in the urban core. A significant amount of this new housing has been developed through the demolition of old single family housing and their replacement with medium- and high-rise apartment buildings. This move has met fierce opposition \u2013 local residents have reacted strongly against the re-densification process arguing that their neighbourhoods cannot cope with the rising demand for sewage, electricity, water and transport infrastructure. The question that arises is whether design can be deployed both at the architectural and local scales to enable densification processes which bring about thriving urban environments without compromising quality of life.<\/p>\n<p>Another crucial piece in the densification programme is the revitalisation of the historic centre, an area of the city that lost around 40% of its population between 1970 and 1995. The urban structure of the historic centre has been constantly deteriorating. This has been accelerated by the increasing presence of the informal economy and the millions of people that make up a transient population have added an enormous pressure on existing infrastructure. Recently, major public and private investments have been pumped into the area and a revitalisation programme has been implemented to reactivate the local economy, restore buildings and the streetscape, and to attract new residents. The main challenges to the historic centre\u2019s regeneration are how to guarantee a percentage of affordable housing, how to solve the problem of the informal sector, and how to avoid the erosion of the city\u2019s most important public and political spaces by incipient gentrification.<\/p>\n<p>Although structural densification of the inner city and control of urban sprawl is without doubt the best step forward, the Bando Dos has become a victim of the lack of regional governance and ended up intensifying some of the problems it set out to solve. As a result of the initiative, the supply of housing has concentrated in the central boroughs of the city and these areas have experienced a significant rise in land and housing prices estimated at between 30% and 50%. Thus, a large sector of the population which is unable both to afford rising prices in the centre and to find housing in the rest of the Federal District, has been expelled to the neighbouring State of Mexico, where commercial builders are developing massive subdivisions of low quality affordable housing. These extensive developments are part of President Fox\u2019s quantitative success story as regards to housing at the national level. Promoting the Mexican ideal of home ownership, there has been three times more housing construction per year since he took office in 2000 than in the previous administration. Although in quantitative terms these commercial developments have provided access to affordable home-ownership to a significant number of Mexicans, they are also the source of considerable problems. By reinforcing the existing segregation pattern of a rich west and south and a poor north and east, they are the new face of today\u2019s urban sprawl in Mexico City\u2019s metropolitan area. Being located at a considerable distance from their residents\u2019 sites of employment, the new housing brings about increased pressures in transport and deepens unsustainable forms of car-oriented urban development in Mexico City. The low quality of this type of housing will increase the already high stock of deteriorating housing, thereby affecting their residents\u2019 quality of life. Furthermore, the lack of integration of housing with other uses, the concentration of affordable housing and its physical isolation from other housing types, and the insufficient and low quality of open and green spaces, accentuate the segregated and fragmented urban structure of the city.<\/p>\n<p>Today over 60% of the total population in the metropolitan area live in \u201cpopular\u201d settlements \u2013 former squatter settlements characterised by a precarious legal status and service provision. The main challenge regarding the most recently formed settlements is the accumulated stock of low quality housing, the lack of services, and housing units with structural deficiencies that are vulnerable to environmental disasters. The settlements that were created approximately thirty years ago are no longer on the periphery and have undergone an important process of consolidation. Partially as a result of the Federal District\u2019s housing improvement programme, these settlements are now experiencing rapid densification \u2013 however, this is often in the form of problematic extensions being added to existing units. The main housing initiative has been to provide loans, mainly for the expansion and improvement of already existing units, thus contributing to the acceleration of the self-help process. An important part of the programme is to provide technical guidance for the construction of these homes. It is the lack of appropriate technical guidance and design principles that has brought about considerable problems, such as: overcrowding, lack of privacy and ventilation and light deficiencies. The programme thus faces an important challenge as to whether it will be able to effectively raise the social and spatial conditions of people living in the consolidated settlements through improved design.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":null,"article_publishing_date":"February 2006","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"101","name":"Iliana","created":"2011-11-01 14:35:08","modified":"2011-11-01 14:35:08","slug":null,"family_name":"Ortega-Alcazar","title":null,"email_address":null,"photo_legacy":null,"profile_text":null,"organization":null,"role":null,"additional_affiliations":null,"qualifications":null,"staff_pages_blurb":null,"office_location":null,"display_after":null,"display_until":null,"extended_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb_lang2":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation_lang2":null,"phone_number":null}],"attachments":false,"gallery":{"slug":false,"extra_classes":"","slides":[]}},{"request_language":"","current_page_uri":"\/media\/search-dev.json","lang2_slug":false,"lang2_name":false,"parent_publication_id":6,"featured_image_uri":"","article_title":"Mexico City: Labour Market and Work Places","permalink":"mexico-city-labour-market-and-work-places","article_subtitle":null,"article_abstract":"","article_summary":"","article_text":"<p>As it is the case with many other contemporary cities around the world, Mexico City is a service-oriented metropolitan area in which the tertiary sector has become the driving force of the regional economy. Even though the region still represents the largest concentration of industrial activities in Mexico, the significance of this sector in the local economy has decreased significantly over the past few decades.<\/p>\n<p>Since the decentralisation policies of the 1970s, many large- and medium-sized enterprises were relocated to other parts of the country. Following the overall crisis of the Mexican economy in the early 1980s and the restructuring and liberalisation that ensued, a large number of smaller establishments were forced to close down as they could not keep up with foreign competitors. In parallel to these processes of de-industrialisation, Mexico City has experienced uneven growth in services that has lead to an overall landscape of economic polarisation. Amidst stagnation and decline, high value-added services such as finance, insurance and real estate, and community, social and personal services have been the only sectors of the formal economy where the city has shown a significant dynamism. With other intermediate sectors contracting \u2013 even formal retail has shrunk in relative terms, the counterpart to this growth at the top has been the spread of micro businesses and the unprecedented expansion of the informal sector.<\/p>\n<p>Some analyst argue that Mexico City is well on its way to becoming a global city based on this considerable expansion of the city\u2019s command and control functions; its increasing integration into global flows of goods, capital, and information; and the surge in large-scale spaces oriented to up-market transnational consumption. Others point out that the city\u2019s development in the globalised economy is considerably vulnerable due to its lack of resilience to macroeconomic shifts and its dependent position within the international urban hierarchy. They further emphasise that the sectors identified with global-city functions only employ a limited segment of the metropolitan workforce and that the globalised enclaves of Mexico City are functionally and territorially disconnected from the rest of the city, where the most alarming sign of urban change manifests itself, namely the enormous swelling of the informal economy.<\/p>\n<p>Some estimates attribute up to half of Mexico City\u2019s total employment to the informal sector. Insufficient employment creation in formal industries and the reduction of real wages appear as the main factors behind this proliferation of informal activities. The informal economy attracts those forced to search for work by any possible means \u2013 diverse segments of the population that include women, seniors, young people of school age and those with lower educational levels. Informality can therefore be characterised by its gender, age and educational biases. Black market retail is the most visible part of the informal economy and the one that arguably most impacts everyday life in the city. A particularly high concentration of informal vendors is noticed in the city\u2019s historic centre and 60% of the revenues generated from informal exchanges are estimated to be located in this area of the city. The number of street vendors has more than doubled over the past five years defeating government\u2019s attempts to curtail their proliferation. Schemes to relocate vendors and regulate their trade through the provision of new commercial plazas and open spaces have been met with either their refusal to change locations, even after an agreement has been reached, or the arrival of new stall holders, occupying the coveted spots left vacant.<\/p>\n<p>This polarised and problematic transition of Mexico City into a service economy has produced an increasingly fragmented metropolis whose sprawling landscape shows evident signs of special unevenness and territorial disjointedness. What remains of its industrial past is located to the north of the city and tends to continually move further out into the metropolitan periphery, leaving behind deteriorating brownfield and unutilised industrial areas that are difficult to re-connect to the existing urban structure. Suburban service-oriented nodes are also characterised by their insularity, their car-orientation and their social and spatial disconnection from their surrounding urban environments. Meanwhile, back in the deteriorating urban core, public space is taken over by the informal sector. The overpowering presence of vendors and their stalls aggravates complex urban conditions \u2013 demand exceeds local infrastructure capacity, pedestrian flows are obstructed, the public realm is degraded to unhygienic and sometimes altogether dangerous levels.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":null,"article_publishing_date":"February 2006","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"101","name":"Iliana","created":"2011-11-01 14:35:08","modified":"2011-11-01 14:35:08","slug":null,"family_name":"Ortega-Alcazar","title":null,"email_address":null,"photo_legacy":null,"profile_text":null,"organization":null,"role":null,"additional_affiliations":null,"qualifications":null,"staff_pages_blurb":null,"office_location":null,"display_after":null,"display_until":null,"extended_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb_lang2":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation_lang2":null,"phone_number":null}],"attachments":false,"gallery":{"slug":false,"extra_classes":"","slides":[]}},{"request_language":"","current_page_uri":"\/media\/search-dev.json","lang2_slug":false,"lang2_name":false,"parent_publication_id":6,"featured_image_uri":"","article_title":"Mexico City: Mobility and Transport","permalink":"mexico-city-mobility-and-transport","article_subtitle":null,"article_abstract":"","article_summary":"","article_text":"<p>On first impressions, one would describe Mexico City as a cityscape oriented to privately-owned cars. Statistics show, however, that the metropolitan area actually depends heavily on public transport and that 81% of all daily journeys are completed by this mode. What the visitor\u2019s impression responds to is use of road space which, almost paradoxically, is almost completely monopolised (95%) by private cars. This contradictory and unsustainable scenario responds to the biases that transport policies have shown since the 1970s, the period during which the city experienced its most rapid demographic and territorial expansion. From this point onwards, Mexico City exploded in size and a road-dominated landscape was consolidated. An entire decade passed without works on the underground railway network, the tramway system was phased out, and priority was given to the construction of roads and car parks that favoured the expansion of individualised forms of private transport. Furthermore, a grid of multi-lane axial roads was built. This grid cut across existing neighbourhoods destroying important parts of the city fabric, and often precipitating their social disintegration as viable urban communities. The emphasis placed on road construction resulted in two important outcomes: it lead to rapid and uncontrolled metropolitan sprawl and, in contradiction to its aim of speeding up automotive transport, it brought about road saturation.<\/p>\n<p>The Mexico City of today faces the challenges of dealing with the legacy of short-sighted transport policies from the past three decades. Car use is still on the rise in the metropolitan area and the occupancy rate is still very low at 1.76 persons per car. The rising trend towards private car use has resulted in an alarming increase in traffic volumes and pollution levels. Originally conceived as the most important form of mass transport and the structuring component of the metropolitan transport infrastructure, the underground has lost relevance over the past years both in terms of its share of total number of trips per person per day and in the absolute number of passengers carried per year. Instead, mini buses have become the backbone of public transport and they account for 60% of all trips in the metropolis. Mini buses represent the least efficient, least safe and one of the most polluting modes of transport. Yet they are the most competitive alternative because of their extended schedules, frequency and coverage throughout the metropolitan area. Additionally, the city suffers from an insufficient and deteriorating pedestrian infrastructure. The current condition of existing roads adds complexity to the task of providing good quality infrastructure for pedestrians and, as they currently stand, roads work as barriers that inhibit pedestrian transit.<\/p>\n<p>It is evident from this situation that there is a pressing need to improve public transport as a sustainable alternative with enough capacity and geographical coverage. However, providing a safer and more efficient public transport network is not only a technical problem. A further barrier to the expansion of public transport is the cultural and class-based preference for private cars. Differences in everyday transport usage reinforce deeply rooted social divisions and segregated practices jeopardise the inherently urban experience of establishing contact, albeit for a brief period of time within one\u2019s daily schedule, with others different from oneself.<\/p>\n<p>Transformed demographics, the increased complexity and relocation of work routines, and the expansion of the metropolitan area itself have had a strong impact on the flows of people and goods within the city. If transport interventions are to remedy the disjointed system in existence and reduce and improve people\u2019s long commutes to work, shopping and entertainment destinations, policy needs to be coordinated at the metropolitan scale. Transport policy needs to be joined-up with land-use and other schemes towards a more coherent territorial structuring of the metropolitan area. If the city is to learn from its past mistakes, these schemes ought to reverse the tendency to build single-use developments that force people to travel large distances. Therefore, improving the existing public transport system is not enough, it is also crucial to better understand the patterns of people\u2019s movements throughout the city and to coordinate transport networks and land-use so that these movements are minimised and successful mixed-use urban quarters are created.<\/p>\n<p>Two contrasting projects embody the divergent courses of action that are being taken by transport policy in Mexico City today. Over the past few years, more than half of the budget allocated to transport was used for road construction, with the most prominent project being a double-decker system of elevated highways over the ring road. On the other hand, with regard to investment on public transport, the most innovative initiative has been the\u00a0<em>Metrobus<\/em>, a bus rapid transit system based on the\u00a0<em>Transmilenio\u00a0<\/em>model from Bogot\u00e1. The new\u00a0<em>Metrobus<\/em>, which replaced over 260 mini buses, consisted of an initial stock of 80 articulated buses covering a distance of 19 kms along the\u00a0<em>Avenida Insurgentes<\/em>, a main north-south axis of the city. The buses have a dedicated lane and make predetermined stops at elevated stations from where passengers can board them swiftly, having already paid their fares on the ground. What these two projects show is that transport planning still oscillates between the old biases and current efforts to break with the past and transform Mexico City into a softer city that responds to the needs of the majority of its population who rely on public transport.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":null,"article_publishing_date":"February 2006","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"101","name":"Iliana","created":"2011-11-01 14:35:08","modified":"2011-11-01 14:35:08","slug":null,"family_name":"Ortega-Alcazar","title":null,"email_address":null,"photo_legacy":null,"profile_text":null,"organization":null,"role":null,"additional_affiliations":null,"qualifications":null,"staff_pages_blurb":null,"office_location":null,"display_after":null,"display_until":null,"extended_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb_lang2":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation_lang2":null,"phone_number":null}],"attachments":false,"gallery":{"slug":false,"extra_classes":"","slides":[]}},{"request_language":"","current_page_uri":"\/media\/search-dev.json","lang2_slug":false,"lang2_name":false,"parent_publication_id":6,"featured_image_uri":"","article_title":"Mexico City: Overview","permalink":"mexico-city-overview","article_subtitle":null,"article_abstract":"","article_summary":"","article_text":"<p>The late 20th Century was the age of economic globalisation. The first part of the 21st Century will be the age of the city, the \u2018Urban\u2019 Age. For the first time in the history of humanity, more than half of the earth\u2019s population will live in an urban area. In China, India, Africa, and Latin America, urban populations are exploding and cities growing exponentially. At the same time, many developed cities are shrinking and being radically restructured as a result of shifting economic bases and new patterns of migration. With investment in urban real estate, infrastructure and renovation becoming the driving force behind economic growth, the physical and social landscapes of the city are being powerfully altered.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Urban policymakers are struggling to balance this massive growth in public and private investment with more sustainable forms of urban development. Questions regarding the shape, size, density and distribution of the city have become increasingly complex and politicised. The concept of the city has come to play a central role in the minds of civic leaders and urban policymakers. The design of the built environment, the distribution of urban density, and their impacts on social inclusion and quality of life, are at the forefront of political discussions in towns and cities across the globe.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Politicians, investors, planners and architects are, in effect, becoming \u2018inebriated\u2019 with cities. In this rapidly changing context, we need to understand the after-effects on this unprecedented urban shift. We need to come to grips with the social \u2018hangover\u2019 that will result from this sustained investment in the physical restructuring of cities worldwide to avoid the disastrous human consequences of so much \u2018planning\u2019 of the last 50 years.\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>These are the questions and issues that have lead to the creation of The Urban Age, a two-year sequence of international conferences held in cities across Africa, Asia, the Americas and Europe in 2005 and 2006.

What distinguished this event from the countless other demonstrations that take place in the city was the central role played by the middle and upper classes. The explicit opposition that many of them show to the party in power has turned issues of crime and safety in Mexico City into extremely political questions. However, beyond the political debate of whether fear of crime is being used and cultivated to achieve political ends and to discredit the current administration, crime is without doubt a major concern shaping public life in the city. The statistics published by city government reveal a substantial rise in crime starting in 1993 and reaching its peak in 1997. Since then crime has gradually decreased, but it is still higher than in 1993. Crime rates also remain comparatively higher than those in other cities.<\/p>\n<p>Fear of crime has promoted the militarisation of public space and the spread of defensible spaces throughout the city. Newcomers are often surprised by the highly visible widespread presence of armed public and private security forces. Public space, rather than being a place of respite and freedom in this bustling metropolis, is nowadays a constantly policed and surveyed environment. In parallel to this militarisation of public space, more and more neighbourhoods are turning into gated communities. Every couple of blocks neighbours get together to install an alarm system, hire private security, and sometimes close their streets off to traffic. Gated communities are, however, no longer limited to the upper classes. The vast number of low-quality affordable residential complexes that are currently being built at a rapid pace are also single-use, gated communities. As a result of these processes, the city is systematically turning inward \u2013 into homes, offices and shopping malls. The evidence in current research on gated communities suggests that far from relieving urbanites from the fear of crime, defensible environments enhance these feelings of fear. Furthermore, gated communities legitimise residential segregation and are one of the elements behind the increasing inequality and polarisation of cities. Rather than building these enclaves, urban design should contribute to the creation of open environments that promote citizens\u2019 identification and involvement with the city. Working together with efficient policies aimed at addressing the sources of crime, urban design can play an important part in alleviating perceptions of crime and in actually securing public spaces. Jane Jacobs\u2019 classic text on New York\u2019s Greenwich Village has long since demonstrated that certain design principles can facilitate the enforcement of informal yet effective security by people themselves.<\/p>\n<p>Demographic expansion, urban sprawl, and fear of crime have resulted in the disintegration of the city \u2013 traditional public spaces now have a reduced significance in public life. Interaction within public spaces has been replaced by interaction through the placeless invisible links of radio, television, video, and the internet. The majority of the inhabitants of Mexico City stay at home rather than use the city in their free time. They do so as a conscious effort to free themselves from the urban hubbub but also, very importantly, as the result of the unequal provision of open and green spaces as well as entertainment and cultural facilities. Initiatives such as the recent redevelopment of the Chapultepec Park &#8211; Mexico City\u2019s largest and more inclusive green space &#8211; and the celebration of free open-air events in the historic centre of the city are positive actions that the Mexico City government has undertaken with the aim of strengthening public life, bringing people together, and encouraging civic engagement. Improving and revitalising existing public spaces, as well as providing good quality open and green spaces in the vast areas currently devoid of them, ought to be regarded as a fundamental point in the agenda if we are to build socially integrated cities.<\/p>\n<p>An additional trend affecting public life in the city is the increased privatisation and commercialisation of public spaces. Face to face interaction now mostly takes place in the new spaces of shopping malls and transport hubs. The amount of public space provided by the colonial plazas is becoming increasingly residential in comparison to the spaces created with premeditated functions in mind the most common of which is consumption. To an important extent, this predetermines the kinds of interaction and activities that take place within them. In addition, the fact that these spaces are characterised by constant surveillance and regulation of access means that they come to reinforce the rise of social exclusion in the city.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":null,"article_publishing_date":"February 2006","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"101","name":"Iliana","created":"2011-11-01 14:35:08","modified":"2011-11-01 14:35:08","slug":null,"family_name":"Ortega-Alcazar","title":null,"email_address":null,"photo_legacy":null,"profile_text":null,"organization":null,"role":null,"additional_affiliations":null,"qualifications":null,"staff_pages_blurb":null,"office_location":null,"display_after":null,"display_until":null,"extended_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb_lang2":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation_lang2":null,"phone_number":null}],"attachments":false,"gallery":{"slug":false,"extra_classes":"","slides":[]}},{"request_language":"","current_page_uri":"\/media\/search-dev.json","lang2_slug":"pt-br","lang2_name":"Portuguese (Brasil)","parent_publication_id":1,"featured_image_uri":"","article_title":"Mobility and the Urban Poor","permalink":"mobility-and-the-urban-poor","article_subtitle":"","article_abstract":"<p>Exploring the links between public transport and quality of life, Alexandre Gomide posits a reframing of the public debate about mobility for the urban poor.<\/p>\n","article_summary":"","article_text":"<p>Poverty is a phenomenon of many dimensions. It is not just about insufficient income to meet basic needs, but also about the deprivation of basic social rights and limited access to essential services such as public transport. Urban poverty manifests itself through the spatial segregation of the poorest in the peripheries \u2013 areas characterised by insubstantial public services and deficient infrastructure \u2013 where the provision of mass transport is inappropriate in terms of price as well as availability. As a result, the poorest have restricted access to the opportunities offered by life in the city.<\/p>\n<p>For the poorest, expenses for transport are very high in relation to their low household incomes. IGBE reported that for 20 per cent of the poorest people living in the S\u00e3o Paulo Metropolitan Region, the cost of urban transport represented around 8 per cent of total family expenses \u2013 double the average of 4 per cent for the entire population. This association between mobility and income is important. The Origin and Destination survey for the S\u00e3o Paulo Metropolitan Region reported in 2002 that people with lower incomes make about 60 per cent of their trips each day on foot while the rich make five times more per day on motorised transport. This indicates serious problems of access to employment opportunities, recreational activities and social facilities, since the distance the poorest are able to reach each day is restricted solely to walking.<\/p>\n<p>Another survey conducted by the Institute of Information and Development in Transportation and the Instituto de Pesquisa Econ\u00f4mia Aplicada identified problems of urban mobility for low-income populations in four Brazilian metropolitan regions, including S\u00e3o Paulo. It showed that people with family incomes up to three times the minimum wage are deprived of access to collective public transport because of the high prices and infrequency of services as well as the difficulty to physically reach distant stations. It also showed that low levels of mobility for leisure activities during weekends are partly due to the prohibitive total cost to transport a family, but also because the scarcity of public transport is even worse on weekends.<\/p>\n<p>The formulation and implementation of public policies for urban transport towards the poor is imperative, especially for those living in metropolitan peripheries. Suggestions to facilitate the mobility of low-income populations include mainly a reduction in the price of tickets, but also an increase of the quantity of services and the reduction of waiting times. Since a large part of the poor live in areas with deficient road infrastructures, paving streets was also recommended to allow vehicle access to their neighbourhoods.<\/p>\n<p>In this sense, it is understood that there needs to be means to subsidise transport for the poor by, for example, extending the benefits of vale-transporte, which is currently provided by employer to employee, to low-income people employed in informal markets. Mechanisms to provide financial assistance for people searching for employment should also be developed. Funding of such programmes must also be taken from sources outside the current revenues from ticket sales, and not from a cross-subsidy among users of the services. A legitimate cross-subsidy in urban transport systems would tax cars in congested areas in view of their negative impact, with the collected resources allocated to subsidise public transport.<\/p>\n<p>Mobility can be improved not only by investments in rapid and efficient transport systems, but by a better distribution of economic and social activities in urban space. Doing so would reduce the distances required for travel. Here, the relationship between land use and transport policies is critical. Their proper integration is a key issue to ensuring sustainability and mobility in cities. Through their integration, it is possible to reduce distances, increase the productivity of the available infrastructure, reduce costs and travel times.<\/p>\n<p>However, such actions are not going to be solved by technicians, but in the political sphere where conflict \u2013 around public budgets, the location of urban activities, the use of property or the granting of public services \u2013 is inevitable. From this perspective we see the need to strengthen and improve democratic institutions and political dialogue. Civic participation in the formulation, monitoring and evaluation of local policies becomes more important every day.<\/p>\n<p><strong><br \/><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":"http:\/\/v0.urban-age.net\/0_downloads\/archive\/_SA\/14_NewsPaper_Essay_Gomide.pdf","article_publishing_date":"December 2008","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"13","name":"Alexandre","created":"2011-08-30 14:51:36","modified":"2011-08-30 15:51:36","slug":"alexandre","family_name":"Gomide","title":null,"email_address":null,"photo_legacy":null,"profile_text":"<p>Alexandre Gomide is a PhD candidate at Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Getulio Vargas and a researcher at the Instituto de Pesquisa Econ\u00f4mica Aplicada.

Imagine thinking about any decision really. That decision will be based on forecasts of your well-being and the well-being of those that you care about. Well-being comes in many guises and will be affected by a range of factors, such as how rich and healthy you are. Sometimes income and health are used as measures of well-being in their own right. To us, well-being is best represented in subjective terms: in essence, by reports of happiness. We use the term &#8216;happiness&#8217; very broadly not only to capture good moods but also to give a sense that life is going well.<br \/> There is now an accumulation of evidence to suggest that we are often not very good at making choices that make us happier. We are often guilty of \u2018miswanting\u2019: of not wanting most the things we will enjoy best. This has important implications for how we think about many things, including urban density and policy.<br \/> Take the decision about how far to live from work. Most of us will think about the trade-off between a longer commute and a bigger house in a less expensive area. The trouble is, we seem to make the wrong trade-offs, at least so far as happiness is concerned. For example, activity-based reports of happiness in the US and in Germany have shown commuting to be one of the least pleasurable activities during the day. Longitudinal data in Germany have been used to show that commuting over two hours a day negatively impacts on life satisfaction, controlling for factors such as income and housing quality. Interestingly, similar data from the UK suggest that women are more likely to be negatively impacted by commuting than men.<br \/> Consider a different example and a different type of study. First-year college students in the US were asked to forecast what their overall level of happiness would be the following year if they lived in various dormitories at their university. The forecasts gave much greater weight to physical features of the dorms, such as location and house, over social ones, such as relationships with roommates and sense of community. A year later, after the students had been randomly assigned to one of the dorms, their happiness was found to have been determined much more by the social features of their dorm than by its physical ones. The students had made a forecasting error.<br \/> Forecasting errors are quite common and we have a pretty good idea about why they come about. When you are making a choice between two houses, for example, you will focus attention on what makes those houses different and in particular on observable characteristics of difference, such as the number and size of rooms. We like to have clear reasons for why we made a particular decision. This \u2018lay rationalism\u2019 means that it is much easier for us to justify \u2013 to ourselves and to other people \u2013 a house purchase based on the size of the house.<br \/> Those observable and justifiable characteristics that draw attention to themselves at the time a decision is made may not be \u2013 and indeed are often unlikely to be \u2013 the characteristics that draw attention to themselves in the experience of that decision. In the experience of our house, for example, we are more likely to be affected by factors such as how well we get on with our neighbours and by traffic noise.<br \/> It may be the case that our happiness is impacted upon by the size of the house in the first few days or weeks, but we quickly adapt to such things as we withdraw attention from them. Something which at first is novel and new \u2013 the big house or the pay rise \u2013 gets our attention but we soon get used to it and our attention quickly finds something new to direct itself at.<br \/> We do not adapt to everything, however. The unpredictable nature of the commute continues to grab our attention as we get held up in traffic or as our train arrives late. The unpredictable noise of the traffic also continues to grab our attention: a study of first-year college students in the US, for example, found that annoyance with noise in college increased over time. Moreover, there was increasing pessimism about adaptation to highway noise: after four months, under one-third spontaneously mentioned noise as something they disliked in the neighbourhood, whereas over one half did after 16 months. The problem is that we are not very good at predicting what we will adapt to and what will continue to grab our attention.<br \/> Our memories do not serve us very well either. Imagine you have just got back from holiday and are asked how much you enjoyed yourself, and whether you would go back again. If you are anything like other people who have been asked these questions, then your answers will be explained by two things: the most extreme and the most recent feelings. This is known as \u2018the peak-end effect\u2019. Your feelings at other times during the holiday would hardly matter at all. Your overall assessment of the holiday would also completely disregard how long it lasted: \u2018duration neglect\u2019. Our memories, even the most recent ones, are etched with extremity and \u2018recency\u2019 but not with duration. As such, they are imperfect guides to our past experiences \u2013 but they do drive our future behaviour.<br \/> For the best part of 100 years, economists have defined \u2018utility\u2019 (well-being) according to the degree to which our preferences are satisfied. If we assume that individuals are rational, fully informed and seek to maximise their utility, then the choices they make will be, by definition, those that maximise expected utility. But prior to this, we thought about utility in terms of feelings. The two definitions would produce similar results and recommendations only if people wanted most what they will eventually enjoy best. But they do not. A good example of this is that smokers appear to become happier after cigarette taxes increase.<br \/> We are all in favour of people being free to choose but our choices \u2013 and our memories of the experiences that follow them \u2013 may not be a very good guide to our well-being.<br \/> Given all of this, we focus on the original conception of utility in economics \u2013 happiness \u2013 rather than the current focus on the degree to which preferences are satisfied. The important thing about happiness data is that they allow us to say what is important in people\u2019s lives when they are not thinking about how important those things are: when they are not engaged in lay rationalism, for example. We cannot overstate how important that is. We ask about happiness and then we find out lots of other things about people, including their income, health, marital status, housing and neighbourhood. Then we look at how important these other things are in explaining people\u2019s happiness. In this way we can find out how important neighbourhoods etc. are, without directly asking people how much they matter, thereby bypassing their \u2018lay rationalism\u2019.<br \/> In relation to urban factors, there is some evidence to suggest that air pollution and noise pollution can affect happiness. It has also been found that living in a highly populated urban area, compared to either a smaller urban town or a rural village, is negatively associated with happiness. There has, however, been little causal work examining how the physical appearance and construction of the neighbourhood affects experiences.<br \/> The measurement of happiness is gaining increasing interest from the academic community and policy-makers around the world. The UK government recently took our recommendations on how to measure happiness in large surveys, and in 2012 we will have over 200,000 British respondents to a range of happiness questions. This will mean that we have the breadth of coverage in the UK to examine clear regional and locational differences in people\u2019s happiness. This could then be correlated with quality of life indices that are often used in regional research, mostly in the US, in order to explore the relationships between happiness and quality of life measures at a regional level.<br \/> The OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development) is also very interested in monitoring happiness in large samples and these data will allow researchers and policy-makers to look more closely at international differences in the determinants of happiness. From the Gallup World Poll it seems that many of the things that matter to happiness are quite similar across different countries and cultures around the world. Things could be different for urbanisation of course, but we have so far not had the data available to explore this. In future work, we should seek to look at how urbanisation affects happiness in one country compared to the next and to look further for some of the contributory factors to any observed differences.<br \/> It is fair to say that much of the evidence to date is based on associations: we know that commuting is associated with lower happiness, but we cannot say for sure how much of that lower happiness is directly caused by commuting. This makes it pretty hard to say just how happy commuters used to long commutes would be with shorter commuting times. We have yet to fully establish causality and control properly for selection effects. In order to do so, we should continue to analyse secondary data, especially household panel data, such as the UK Household Living Survey and the German Socio-Economic Panel. We could also start to examine those who move house, their reasons for moving and the implications for their happiness. What is potentially interesting about the UK data is that it includes children as part of a youth survey. As children have little say in where they grow up, we can find out how the characteristics and experiences of the local neighbourhood when they are young impact on their circumstances and happiness when they are adults. This will help us to start to map the life-course consequences of cities and localities on people\u2019s outcomes and happiness.<br \/> The lack of suitable data does limit how far this approach can take us, however. We should therefore also make much more use of field experiments, which, with innovative designs and the right research partners, have the potential to shed some significant light on the causes of happiness that are of interest to urban economists and others. For example, akin to the US \u2018Moving to Opportunity\u2019 scheme, we could randomly give housing vouchers to individuals living in poor neighbourhoods to enable them to live in better neighbourhoods. We could assess their happiness and other characteristics before giving out the vouchers, and then follow up with all the residents once they have moved. Such a study with a clear strategy for identifying causality will allow us to determine the impact that neighbourhood and cities actually have on people\u2019s lives and experiences.In taking this and other research forwards, we recognise that the traditional economic approach to urban issues is important in understanding why we gather and live together to form cities. We have a clear incentive to do so since we are not self-sufficient. So by gathering in cities, we can produce more goods (due to economies of scale and comparative advantage) and therefore demand more goods, and have higher economic resources as a result.<br \/> We do not always optimise our economic resources, let alone our happiness. This has important implications for how we structure and plan major urban areas, and how we judge whether planners actually increase people\u2019s happiness. Most people around the world already live in urban areas, generating major problems to overcome through urban planning and other interventions, especially with respect to environmental and health challenges. At the very least, we should incorporate happiness effects into our models of cost-benefit analysis and indeed the UK is already making moves in this direction.<br \/> The planning and design of urban spaces and cities can greatly enhance people\u2019s lives. They can also make people miserable. Researchers in urban economics, as elsewhere, need to get out into the field and directly assess the well-being and behavioural consequences of different places and spaces.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":null,"article_publishing_date":"November 2011","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"113","name":"Paul","created":"2011-11-04 11:26:06","modified":"2011-11-04 11:26:06","slug":null,"family_name":"Dolan","title":null,"email_address":null,"photo_legacy":null,"profile_text":null,"organization":null,"role":null,"additional_affiliations":null,"qualifications":null,"staff_pages_blurb":null,"office_location":null,"display_after":null,"display_until":null,"extended_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb_lang2":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation_lang2":null,"phone_number":null},{"id":"114","name":"Robert","created":"2011-11-04 11:26:20","modified":"2011-11-04 11:26:20","slug":null,"family_name":"Metcalfe","title":null,"email_address":null,"photo_legacy":null,"profile_text":null,"organization":null,"role":null,"additional_affiliations":null,"qualifications":null,"staff_pages_blurb":null,"office_location":null,"display_after":null,"display_until":null,"extended_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb_lang2":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation_lang2":null,"phone_number":null}],"attachments":false,"gallery":{"slug":false,"extra_classes":"","slides":[]}},{"request_language":"","current_page_uri":"\/media\/search-dev.json","lang2_slug":false,"lang2_name":false,"parent_publication_id":10,"featured_image_uri":"","article_title":"Mumbai: The Compact Mega City","permalink":"mumbai-the-compact-mega-city","article_subtitle":"","article_abstract":"<p>The relationship between compact urban form and public transport efficiency is unique to Indian cities, and as Philipp Rode argues, could form the basis of a sustainable transport strategy that will support future urban growth.<\/p>\n","article_summary":"","article_text":"<p><div id=\"attachment_161\" style=\"width: 1290px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-161\" src=\"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/10\/Chirodeep-Chaudhuri_Bandra-Worli-sea-link-Bandra-fort.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" \/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Bandra-Worli sea link forms part of the Western Express Highway.<\/p><\/div>\n<p>In Greater Mumbai, the equivalent of more than twice the population of Denmark shares 450 km2 of land. The key driver of Mumbai\u2019s compactness is its physical geography. There are only a few places where the composition of land and water demands the creation of a city. The natural harbour of New York, the bay of Tokyo and Rio de Janeiro are prominent examples. So is the opening of Thane creek, the largest natural harbour on India\u2019s west coast. Protected by a 650 km2 island extending into the Arabic sea, the bay is now almost entirely urbanised by present-day Mumbai. About a third of Greater Mumbai\u2019s population lives on the southern \u2018finger\u2019 of the island ,with more than two-thirds of the jobs located there. Attempts to shift jobs to more accessible areas of the region have initially failed; Navi Mumbai on the other side of Thane creek remains a ghost city and its vast amount of housing and office buildings are only slowly beginning to be occupied. This is largely seen as a result of real estate speculation and greater interest in developing South Mumbai, where the chronic shortage of office space promised far higher returns.<\/p>\n<p>Implementing transport infrastructure and organising mobility while sustaining a strategic vision for development of the city is one of the most critical pressure points of urban governance in Mumbai. The exceptional densities of the city result in similarly unusual transport patterns. By far the largest group of commuters in Greater Mumbai \u2013 about 55 per cent \u2013 walk to work. Most of them are able to reach their workplace within 15 minutes or less, making the most significant contribution to the city\u2019s extremely low average commuting times of 25 minutes, a sharp contrast to the London average of 42 minutes. The distribution amongst other modes of transport is less surprising. Twenty-two per cent use trains and 14 per cent use buses as their main means of travel. Two wheelers account for 3 per cent, motor rickshaws and private cars each for 2 per cent of the commutes.<\/p>\n<p>Access to the city is not a mere question of modal choice. In Mumbai, it dictates location, proximity and daily routines more than in most other cities, particularly for the urban poor. The enormous value attached to city access is expressed by the compromising living conditions. Personal living space of less than 3 m2 is accepted as long as it keeps the promise of employment despite residential densities \u2013 in some cases of just two-storey slum houses \u2013 higher than the vertical urbanisation of Hong Kong or Manhattan.<\/p>\n<p>City access further relies on a high degree of urban mix. The fine-grain topography of urban environments cater best for the enormous need for constant exchange, not least due to physical proximity allowing for inexpensive and flexible non-motorised travel. In India \u2018the poor need to live close to the rich.\u2019 However, higher housing standards, whether in terms of living space or amenities, are traded for ease of access. Ironically, centrally located informal dwellers are often re-located to allow for new transport infrastructure, further increasing the overall demand for mobility. Each family will be offered a 20 m2 apartment at no cost. However, the new housing units built at the fringes of the city do not reflect any of the cultural and professional requirements of those being resettled. And the long and expensive trips to the centres of urban activity have deprived them from city access.<\/p>\n<p>Mumbai has inherited the most extensive urban rail system on the Indian subcontinent. About 300 km of suburban rail served by 95 stations make use of the city\u2019s linear geography, moving 6.4 million people daily. However, the railway\u2019s success has become its greatest enemy. Passengers suffer a degree of overcrowding unknown on any other rail system of similar size. Each minute, trains arriving at Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus and Churchgate Station inject 2,000 people into the city\u2019s historic core during rush hour. Nine-car trains designed to hold 1,700 passengers travel with up to 5,000 commuters, with an average of 13 people per day killed in rail related accidents.<\/p>\n<p>Regardless of Mumbai\u2019s density and compactness, the city experiences a massive increase in motorised vehicles, generally following the same pattern of most cities in developing economies. Between 1991 and 2005, the number of motorised vehicles more than doubled from 0.6 to 1.3 million. With a total of 6 million cars, motorisation in India is still relatively low and almost exclusively an urban phenomenon. And while no city in India is prepared to accommodate this growth, Mumbai\u2019s dense urban environment proves particularly vulnerable to the flood of vehicles. The city\u2019s streets cover only about 11 per cent of its surface, compared to 21 per cent in Delhi and 22 per cent in New York City. And while the number of vehicles multiplied 37 times over the last 50 years, the length of the Mumbai\u2019s road network only doubled. Congestion is severe and due to the high stress levels of driving, the lack of parking and the overall affluence of the owners of those cars, about 70 per cent of private cars on the street are driven by chauffeurs.<\/p>\n<p>The most significant road expansion programme is a controversial multi-million dollar off-shore ring-road, the Sea Link. The first segment, the 5.6-km Bandra-Worli Sea Link, is currently under construction. This US$350 million project boasts an eight-lane bridge, promoted as a new landmark for Mumbai. Built exclusively for fast moving vehicles, it is limited to four wheelers and above, thus catering to the city\u2019s 2 per cent of the population with private cars. In one hour it will serve just about the same amount of people as two trains arriving at and leaving from Churchgate Station. Although not designed to accommodate mass transport, recent political pressure may require two dedicated lanes for buses.<\/p>\n<p>The latest plans for the city assumes that the total population within the metropolitan region will increase to 34 million by 2031. Within 25 years, an additional 12 million people will need to navigate the city\u2019s territory. Strategic planning for the location of homes, jobs, retail and other activities will end up as the single most significant transport strategy. Of similar importance will be the recognition of the fine grain, mix-use urban legacy that has made Mumbai such a unique mega city. Mumbai has the one-time opportunity to merge a strategy that improves the standard of living while maintaining its valuable compact urban form.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-162\" title=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/10\/transport-infrastructure_MBI_withSeaLink_watermark.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"1280\" \/><\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":null,"article_publishing_date":"November 2007","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"22","name":"Philipp","created":"2011-10-04 13:03:47","modified":"2013-11-14 11:36:32","slug":"rode-philipp","family_name":"Rode","title":"","email_address":"p.rode@lse.ac.uk","photo_legacy":"\/0_images\/02-PRode.jpg","profile_text":"Philipp Rode is Executive Director of LSE Cities and Senior Research Fellow at the LSE.

They include retired and injured resource industry workers, people addicted to illegal drugs or alcohol, people released from mental institutions that have been closed, single-parent families, as well as about 1,000 people who are street homeless or who live in shelters. Some are there because they have no choice; most because it is their community.<\/p>\n<p>Downtown Eastside also has a very active and visible illegal drug trade and its main shopping street has 20 to 30 per cent vacant storefronts. At the same time, the area is located near a thriving central business district and high-density middle-income residential areas. It also features heritage buildings, parks, theatres and views of the bay and mountains and, as a result, it is potentially attractive to market housing and downtown support services that are threatening to gentrify the area and displace the poor.<\/p>\n<p>I want to share a few observations from my experience of working with low-income communities as the Senior Planner for Downtown Eastside between 1993 and 2008, as well as my work as a community planner with the City of Vancouver Planning Department for 25 years. In the mid-1990s, the question for Vancouver City officials was: &#8216;should we let gentrification and displacement take place &#8220;naturally&#8221;, should we provide incentives to speed up the process or should we try to stop it from happening?&#8217;. The City Council, following staff recommendations, chose the latter: it had found no definitive evidence that a concentration of low-income residents was \u2013 in and of itself \u2013 a bad thing. They chose not to pursue a community planning process, which would have effectively involved saying: &#8216;we are going to improve your neighbourhood but about 50 per cent of existing residents will have to leave&#8217;.<\/p>\n<p>In our approach to community planning, we defined \u2018gentrification\u2019 as the transformation of an area that once housed low-income and working-class households, to one dominated by middle- or upper-income households and values. Irrespective of the causes, in areas with heritage character such as Downtown Eastside, people and businesses that can afford higher prices start to bid up the costs of real estate, and the following processes start to unfold:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Housing becomes unaffordable to low- and moderate-income households;<\/li>\n<li>Expensive shops and restaurants replace those that are more affordable;<\/li>\n<li>The new homeowners, tenants and businesses form an alliance to control the public realm and policing, and long-term residents become strangers in their own communities as their behaviour on the street is challenged; and<\/li>\n<li>The newcomers also form alliances to oppose not only new health and social services needed by the poor, but also to claim that some existing services should be closed because the area has more than its &#8216;fair share&#8217;.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The strategy in Vancouver has been to try to reverse these processes of gentrification. The key has been securing low-income housing \u2013 to fulfil a City Council commitment to replace single-room-occupancy residential \u2018hotels\u2019 (SROs) one-to-one with purpose-built social housing. The housing plan also calls for a mix of housing, with a strong emphasis on affordable rental units. This includes housing affordable to support and service workers working in Downtown Eastside and in the nearby Central Business District so they don\u2019t have to commute from distant neighbourhoods. The plan is intended to create a more inclusive social mix, rather than just very high- and very low-income people, and to allow those who climb out of poverty a chance to remain in the neighbourhood.<\/p>\n<p>The strategy also includes an economic revitalisation plan that has provisions to create jobs and affordable commercial services for low-income residents, community-based policing that is reflective of the values of existing as well as new residents and business people, inclusive public spaces and needed health facilities, ranging from a dental clinic to North America\u2019s first supervised injection site for people who use illegal drugs.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, a significant part of the strategy has been challenging to realise in the face of significant government cutbacks, especially in the provision of social housing, but also some essential social and community economic development services. That said, for a number of reasons, including the commitment of the City Council, local residents and community organisations, much of the strategy continues to move forward.<\/p>\n<p>Staff from the City Council and senior government officials have concluded that it is not the number or the density of low-income groups in an area that matters, but rather the sense of community. These ideas have been influenced by the work of Dr Bruce Alexander of Simon Fraser University, who has written about the &#8216;globalization of addiction&#8217;, as well as by direct experience in working on the Downtown Eastside strategy. Alexander describes how many people in North America and Europe suffer from addictions, not only to illegal drugs, but also to smoking, alcohol, shopping, food and work. He says the cause is the sense of dislocation people feel in a world that is changing so rapidly \u2013 and feels beyond our control. Alexander claims that, if the cause is rapid change and the symptom is addiction, the cure is community \u2013 a sense of belonging \u2013 where your skills are valued, where personal shortcomings are tolerated, and where you are known and can come to know yourself.<\/p>\n<p>So how do we build a sense of community? In the case of Vancouver\u2019s Downtown Eastside, we concluded that:<\/p>\n<p>It comes from struggle, and first and foremost, the struggle for neighbourhood identity. In our case, the name, Downtown Eastside, was invented to indicate that this area of the city was no longer \u2018Skid Row\u2019 or slum as it had formerly been called. Today, this sense of struggle continues as low-income people to fight for housing and the services they need to survive<\/p>\n<p>Then it comes from survival. In the 1970s, the community of Downtown Eastside fought hard to get the city to install sprinklers in SROs so that residents would not be burned to death in fires. More recently extremely high rates of HIV, AIDS, Hepatitis C, and other infectious diseases, have been significantly reduced as a result of the successful fight to achieve innovative health services, such as a needle exchange and North America\u2019s first supervised injection site.<\/p>\n<p>Then from gathering. The Carnegie Community Centre was created in Downtown Eastside in the 1980s to serve as a \u2018living room\u2019 for the many residents living in very small residential units. It is funded by the city and managed by a community-based board of directors, providing much-needed cultural and recreational services and a base for community organising around a wide range of issues. Other public spaces of social meaning have also been created and revitalised sensitively with considerably community engagement, as has been the case with Oppenheimer Park, where the Japanese were rounded up during World War II.<\/p>\n<p>Then from political power. There have been many voter registration drives and several outstanding individuals from Downtown Eastside have been elected to public office at all three levels of government.<\/p>\n<p>Then from local enterprise. Downtown Eastside\u2019s \u2018United We Can\u2019 is a bottle recycling plant that is owned and operated by the \u2018binners\u2019 who scratch a living by collecting bottles, but the area also includes community-owned coffee shops, grocery stores, housing providers and maintenance and security companies.<\/p>\n<p>Then from nutrition. Pot Luck caf\u00e9 is community-owned and provides affordable food in a small restaurant that is open to the general public. It also has a very profitable catering service that trains and hires local residents and raises money that helps feed the poor through community kitchens in Downtown Eastside\u2019s many SROs and social housing projects. The Downtown Eastside Neighbourhood House is working with other groups including Carnegie and Pot Luck to improve the quality and quantity of healthy food available to the poor.<\/p>\n<p>Then from expression. There are many community arts initiatives in Downtown Eastside. At the forefront is the annual \u2018Heart of City\u2019 festival, which helps many local residents to demonstrate their skills to a city-wide audience, whether as performers, set-makers or ticket sellers, and enhances community pride. Based on Venezuela\u2019s El Sistema method, the St James Music Academy gives more than 125 low-income children the opportunity to learn to play classical music \u2013 an experience from which they also gain self-discipline and a sense of being part of a community. And the programme has ripple-like effects on their families and their friends and neighbours\u2019 families.<\/p>\n<p>Many low-income residents in neighbourhoods such as Vancouver\u2019s Downtown Eastside have faced incredible challenges in their lives. Public officials and community leaders are often pressured into making decisions \u2013 either explicitly or through inaction in the face of market forces \u2013 that result in the dispersion of the poor from areas in which they have been concentrated. Low-income communities have been treated at times as if they were social bacteria infecting society. Such processes and treatments are harmful, not only to the low-income residents who are scattered to places where they have little social support, but also to us all.<\/p>\n<p>Addiction is something that affects all of our lives. A strong sense of community can be an important part of \u2018treatment\u2019, helping to reduce the negative impacts of addiction.<\/p>\n<p>The experience of the Downtown Eastside community suggest that it may be worthwhile to look for leadership in those who have gone through the pains of the worst our societies have offered, and who have come back from these severe circumstances with a sense of compassion and confidence. They may be the social \u2018coal\u2019 transformed into \u2018diamond\u2019, able to teach low-income people in their communities and, perhaps as importantly, to help lead us all toward better societies.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/11\/2011_chw_5085_Edelson.pdf","article_publishing_date":"November 2011","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"136","name":"Nathan","created":"2011-11-04 11:46:06","modified":"2011-11-04 11:46:06","slug":null,"family_name":"Edelson","title":null,"email_address":null,"photo_legacy":null,"profile_text":null,"organization":null,"role":null,"additional_affiliations":null,"qualifications":null,"staff_pages_blurb":null,"office_location":null,"display_after":null,"display_until":null,"extended_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb_lang2":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation_lang2":null,"phone_number":null}],"attachments":false,"gallery":{"slug":false,"extra_classes":"","slides":[]}},{"request_language":"","current_page_uri":"\/media\/search-dev.json","lang2_slug":"pt-br","lang2_name":"Portuguese (Brasil)","parent_publication_id":1,"featured_image_uri":"","article_title":"New Urban Opportunities","permalink":"new-urban-opportunities","article_subtitle":"","article_abstract":"<p align=\"justify\">In a critique of the status quo\u2019s preference for privatised urban development and banal urban forms, Raul Juste Lores advocates a fundamental shift to reclaim the architectural richness of existing infrastructure in S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s centre.<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0<\/p>\n","article_summary":"","article_text":"<p><div id=\"attachment_62\" style=\"width: 406px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-62\" title=\"11_SA08Ref_Lores1\" src=\"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/08\/11_SA08Ref_Lores1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"396\" height=\"228\" \/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">High-end office space is concentrated in towers such as these overlooking the Marginal Pinheiros River in the Berrini region, the second largest financial district in S\u00e3o Paulo.

But how can such a young city, which only became important in the second half of the twentieth century, now be seen as an incorrigible old hand?<\/p>\n<p>In this era of global competition, in which cities want to impress investors and tourists and recruit talented nomads and resources, S\u00e3o Paulo does not present an image of modernity. Missing are Shanghai\u2019s Maglev, Dubai\u2019s new skyline and Tokyo\u2019s high-speed trains. Old and insufficient infrastructure is everywhere: 62 km of metro lines compared to 200 km in Mexico City; hour-long connections between the airport and city centre that depend on taxis; and rivers, the city\u2019s business cards, which are dead and stinking despite decades of investment to clean them.<\/p>\n<p>Trying to assess where S\u00e3o Paulo went wrong or to identify solutions involves confronting questions, which range from a lack of mobility to architectural ugliness and residents\u2019 feelings of insecurity \u2013 even in safe areas. S\u00e3o Paulo needs to analyse itself, and correcting its future growth would be a good starting point.<\/p>\n<p>Over the last 20 years, the Berrini and the Na\u00e7\u00f5es Unidas Avenues have shown the greatest economic strength in S\u00e3o Paulo. Yet the area\u2019s expansion reveals a series of mistakes, especially in the inhuman, arid and unsustainable form the city is adopting \u2013 mistakes that were not due to a lack of money as with other cities in the developing world. The roads that surround the area are only suitable for cars, never for public transport, and they send a clear message: use your car because you cannot rely on access via a metro line or bus.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_65\" style=\"width: 406px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-65\" title=\"11_SA08Ref_Lores2\" src=\"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/08\/11_SA08Ref_Lores22.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"396\" height=\"228\" \/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The business services which make S\u00e3o Paulo the leading financial centre of South America have yet to occupy the modernist structures in the city centre. These commercial buildings, the result of feverish building activity accompanying industrialization, encapsulate the city\u2019s entrepreneurial spirit yet remain largely vacant.<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Real estate speculation has transformed what was once a marginal area inhabited by slums into a series of so-called \u2018intelligent\u2019 high-rise buildings that shut out the city. In some cases, it is difficult to find an entrance other than the car park or the garage. Blocks are over-sized, there are no trees or public spaces, and the ground floors lack bars, restaurants and shops. Even during the day his areas seems uninhabited apart from the permanent traffic congestion surrounding it.<br \/>Property developers bought the area cheaply and built-up the last square centimetre. Subsequent lobbying on behalf of the corporations that settled there forced the government to bring in electricity and water supplies, as well as public transport and other public services, leaving the bill to be picked up by the public coffers. S\u00e3o Paulo has repeated this property market cycle now several times: first abandoning the centre for Avenida Paulista in the 1960s, then Paulista for Brigadeiro Faria Lima Avenue in the 1980s and now with this western area since the 1990s. Rehabilitation and modernisation of the city\u2019s architectural heritage is alarmingly rare \u2013 existing buildings are neglected while new financial districts are created.<br \/>S\u00e3o Paulo is, increasingly, an octopus whose tentacles stretch further and further outwards, making it impossible to provide efficient public transport. The tentacles head in all directions: to the West, where the corporate world, gated communities and high-rise buildings proliferate. While the centre has hundreds of empty areas, abandoned buildings and waste land, the poorest people seek housing on the edge of the city, in the North, East and South, polluting areas that should be environmentally preserved, and contaminating the reservoirs that provide the metropolis\u2019 drinking water.<br \/>In both the expansion of the suburbs and of financial districts, public powers arrive too late, and thus institutionalise the errors made. And despite S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s construction boom and unprecedented economic growth over the last 30 years, resources are not being directed to correct previous mistakes. Both the Mayor and the state government are required to act as educators and regulators for managed growth, and neither should be afraid to curb certain investments, put up barriers or impose conditions.<br \/>The unwelcoming character of the Berrini and Marginal Pinheiros areas can be addressed through demands to the property developers themselves. Buildings over fifteen-storeys high should allow for the creation of a square, a garden or a public space that enhances the street-front experience. Avenues need restaurants, bars, shops, pharmacies and bookshops on the ground floors. These functions animate streetlife throughout the day and night, and provide the social surveillance that S\u00e3o Paulo so desperately needs.<br \/>Why is it, then, that Avenida Paulista is more secure day and night than other parts of the city? It is because its design embraces the city and mixed-use. There is Trianon Park, public squares, wide pavements, medium-sized blocks and an eclectic occupation. Next to large residential buildings, such as Paulic\u00e9ia, Saint Honore, the Na\u00e7\u00f5es Unidas and Tres Marias, there are banks, schools, colleges, hospitals, pharmacies and pubs, newspaper stands and cultural centres such as the Theatre of SESI, Ita\u00fa Cultural and MASP.<br \/>Conjunto Nacional proves that S\u00e3o Paulo once knew how to build intelligent buildings. On its 33 floors, divided into three blocks, there are offices and apartments with separate entrances. The wide pavements outside the building are made of the same material as the floors inside, thus obliterating the boundaries between public and private. The ground floor hosts cinemas, shops, banks, pharmacies and restaurants. This varied use demonstrates how to inject modernity and new life in a 1950s building without damaging it. The result is that the block of the Conjunto Nacional is the liveliest on Avenida Paulista. Continuous streams of people walk the area, weekdays and weekends. In a city that is prisoner to the paranoia about safety, the generous and welcoming architecture of Conjunto Nacional offers coexistence and safety for thousands of people. Criminals, who prefer dark and abandoned places where they can be left alone, are unwelcome there.<br \/>Why have the postmodern buildings of the Marginal Pinheiros and Berrini never managed to repeat the success that the Conjunto Nacional, designed in 1953, still has in 2008? If the current real estate market of S\u00e3o Paulo prefers repetitive and simple solutions, it is the responsibility of the public powers to make demands that can \u2018build the city\u2019. The same permissiveness exists in the planning for shopping malls despite extensive literature about how malls damage the urban landscape. S\u00e3o Paulo now has nearly 80 malls. In five years, the Daslu, Cidade Jardim and Vila Ol\u00edmpia malls were built next to older ones such as Iguatemi, Morumbi, D&amp;D and Market Place. The result is a chain of seven malls within 10 km2. Just as the Mayor can veto building a hundred-storey tall tower because of its impact on the neighbourhood, or can prevent the demolition of a house built in the 1920s, permission for the construction of new shopping malls should require contractors to think about alternatives.<br \/>Any intervention that makes a Paulistano not use a car, but instead walk for a few hours on the street in public space, would already have an educational value. Not only because the streets \u2013 like the ones in Manhattan, Buenos Aires, Paris or Rio de Janeiro \u2013 would be full of people, but also because if S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s elite occupied the streets, there would be greater demand for the care of pavements, traffic signs, and urban furniture.<br \/>The new malls could remember the trade streets that marked the Paulistano centre, such as the Barao de Itapetininga. The shopping mall typology that has dominated the past 40 years is not sustainable. Beijing has just inaugurated the Sanlitun Village mall which features 19 low buildings, up to four-storeys high, designed by 16 different architects. The result creates diversity among the buildings, vast pavements and safe alleyways. It is, in effect, an open mall. So why continue to allow projects that do not give anything back to the urban landscape?<br \/>In Tokyo, where real estate is more expensive and scarcer than in any neighbourhood of S\u00e3o Paulo, municipal regulations required the multifunctional complex of Tokyo Midtown to set aside 40,000 m2 of gardens, with an art gallery in the middle, as public space. Roppongi Hills sponsored the design of banks around the enterprise. In Berrini, builders have already demonstrated that they will not care for the city of their own volition. Regulations could force them to look after the design and maintenance of bus stops, benches and squares \u2013 investments that would only enhance their property values.<br \/>Pal\u00e1cio das Ind\u00fastrias, Casa das Retortas, Memorial da Am\u00e9rica Latina, Casa e Parque Modernistas e Parque Trianon, are all well-known names for Paulistanos, but what do they have in common? The first two are large historic public buildings that have been empty for years, waiting for a new use. The others are freely accessible public spaces that are empty during weekends. Meanwhile, S\u00e3o Paulo has built several theatres in recent years in a region beyond the Marginal Pinheiros and Berrini. For most of the public it takes up to an hour and a half by car to get to a concert or a play. The public authorities have failed to create incentives to use empty and centrally located places that already have infrastructure and public transport.<br \/>In a city that has only a handful of buildings more than 150 years old, the heritage of the small town that became the largest metropolis in South America should make preservation and re-investment in the centre a priority. There are dozens of empty or underused twenty-storey buildings. Yet despite the rhetoric about revitalising the historic centre, the last remaining large companies and law offices have left in the last five years.<br \/>Residential projects in the centre do not succeed because either humble people without savings are installed in twenty-storey buildings in which the lifts alone generate service charges expected of middle-class housing; or because the \u2018brand\u2019 of the centre still has a negative connotation. Buenos Aires with its Puerto Madero, Mexico City with its historical districts of Condesa and Roma, and Bogot\u00e1 with Macarena prove that even cities poorer than S\u00e3o Paulo can recover derelict neighbourhoods and transform buildings of past decades into local versions of Soho and Chelsea in New York City or the fashionable Marais district in Paris.<br \/>S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s centre has the highest concentration of museums and cultural facilities in the city, the most metro stops and bus stations, several squares, wide pavements and public buildings, and the police is more present there than in other areas. The centre is also strategically located in the middle of the city.<br \/>Why, then, has the revitalisation of the centre not worked? The answer is that the boost given by the public authorities was too timid. Large construction companies could have been required to think about alternatives in the empty centre or even retrofit buildings whose historical charm is an added bonus. Photographers, visual artists, stylists, advertising executives, musicians and designers have never needed an explicit and direct invitation from the authorities to occupy these voids. The city quickly expropriates whole buildings to make room for viaducts, tunnels and other works, but it cannot allow new uses for empty buildings in the centre for professionals in the creative industries who are priced out of overvalued properties in Vila Madalena, Vila Olimpia or Jardins.<br \/>The Pinacoteca, the Sala S\u00e3o Paulo and the Museu da L\u00edngua Portuguesa, all excellent cultural institutions, suffer from a pre-supposed revitalisation of their neighbourhoods. They remain isolated buildings, where users arrive and leave hastily by car, avoiding any intrusion into the areas beyond their walls. Nobody thought about creating offices, residential use or studios \u2013 subsidised or not \u2013 which could have provided a halo effect for the surroundings.<br \/>One of the recent examples of S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s vitality can be seen at Roosevelt Square. A pile of concrete since the 1960s, when it was constructed to connect express roads and viaducts, Roosevelt Square was the locus of drug trafficking and prostitution until five years ago. Its devalued residential buildings, however, now have new uses on the ground floor: cinemas and bars sit next to alternative theatre groups in search of cheap space. From the dramaturgic talent to urban opportunity, Roosevelt Square now hosts bars and seven theatres that offer plays throughout the day to pay for their expenses.<br \/>The courage of the pioneers and the growing movement in the area has driven away criminals. Roosevelt Square has thus turned into a small village in the city centre. But despite years of discussions and promises, a \u2018pentagon\u2019 of concrete prevents it from becoming a real square. A landscape design project would allow the Roosevelt \u2018movement\u2019 to spread to neighbouring streets, building even more theatres, pizzerias, and bars and bringing even more lively youngsters to the area. Several other areas in the centre could host clusters of creative industries, such as the beautiful working class village next to Casa de Dona Yay\u00e1 in Bexiga, the empty plot beside the Teatro da Oficina, the large pavements with galleries from the 1950s, the beautiful Largo do Arouche, the Avenida Vieira de Carvalho, and the abandoned Vila Itoror\u00f3.<br \/>The success of the Cidade Limpa (Clean City) project, which focused exclusively on removing billboards and outdoor advertisements from the streets of S\u00e3o Paulo, shows how even very small interventions can have a strong impact on Paulistanos\u2019 perception of their city. This was not an expensive project, but it managed to counter the belief that \u2018S\u00e3o Paulo is hopeless\u2019. That the project stopped working reinforces the idea of timidity of S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s public management. The billboards hid an ugly and grey metropolis that is now visible, and the government\u2019s failure to improve the urban landscape only adds to Paulistanos\u2019 low self-esteem.<br \/>Twenty-two years ago, Barcelona changed its landscape with the \u2018Barcelona, posa&#8217;te Guapa\u2019 project, which combined the withdrawal of outdoor advertising with concessions for temporary billboards. When renovating the fa\u00e7ade of a historic building, the sponsors were permitted to put their logo on the protective mesh covering the work. With the ban on billboards, street advertising was thus transformed into something more valuable that gave the local authorities enormous bargaining power when it came to making better use of existing resources.<br \/>S\u00e3o Paulo has one of the world\u2019s largest collections of architectural modernism: from the 1930s to the 1960s the city was what Shanghai is nowadays. Yet despite several works by Oscar Niemeyer, a cultural or tourist map does not utilise this heritage. Recovering the self-image of the city would start with these architectural landmarks. If it wants to be beautiful, S\u00e3o Paulo needs to dust off, polish and illuminate its past glories as any old European city knows. That the fa\u00e7ade of Copan is in poor condition, that the Esther building from 1936 has a decrepit front, and that historically important if not architecturally revolutionary buildings like Martinelli or Sampaio Moreira seem semi-derelict, show the challenges ahead for S\u00e3o Paulo.<br \/>S\u00e3o Paulo needs to re-embrace architecture, just as it did in the years of accelerated boom and confidence in the future \u2013 in the years when its elite created the MASP, the Biennale and the Museum of Modern Art. This could give its young talent the opportunity to build better than the repetitive and awkward custom of today\u2019s real estate market. It could ease the entry of talented foreign architects, who would bring new perspectives, new materials and sensibilities to the city. It could also allow the creation of social housing projects by local architects finding new forms rather than the hundreds of identical \u2018crates\u2019 on the periphery. Lastly, the city could create public-private partnerships and international competitions for the construction of major buildings, with prizes awarded by the public for projects that stimulate beauty and create collective spaces that, rather than frighten, attract the Paulistano.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":"http:\/\/v0.urban-age.net\/0_downloads\/archive\/_SA\/11_NewsPaper_Essay_Lores.pdf","article_publishing_date":"December 2008","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"172","name":"Raul","created":"2012-02-29 12:06:53","modified":"2012-02-29 12:06:53","slug":null,"family_name":"Juste Lores","title":null,"email_address":null,"photo_legacy":null,"profile_text":null,"organization":null,"role":null,"additional_affiliations":null,"qualifications":null,"staff_pages_blurb":null,"office_location":null,"display_after":null,"display_until":null,"extended_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb_lang2":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation_lang2":null,"phone_number":null}],"attachments":false,"gallery":{"slug":false,"extra_classes":"","slides":[]}},{"request_language":"","current_page_uri":"\/media\/search-dev.json","lang2_slug":false,"lang2_name":false,"parent_publication_id":2,"featured_image_uri":"","article_title":"New York: Housing and Neighbourhoods","permalink":"new-york-housing-and-neighbourhoods","article_subtitle":null,"article_abstract":"","article_summary":"","article_text":"<p>New York is the most European of America\u2019s big cities in at least one way. The city depends on public transport to a far greater extent than does Los Angeles, or even Chicago. Just over 50 per cent of New York City\u2019s working population travel to work by public transport. Like London, where the figure is around 40%, it began building its transit system in the 19th century and experienced an explosive period of growth in the first half of the 20th century fuelled by suburban railway lines, also like London.<\/p>\n<p>But then New York had Robert Moses to build the parkways, while London produced Frank Pick, to usher in the golden age of London Transport\u2019s unified system of busses and tube trains, tied together with a network of elegant station architecture, its specially designed typeface, and its iconic system map. Both cities struggled to live up to those glory days throughout the 1970s and 1980s when they appeared locked in a downward spiral of decline, with poorer standards and dwindling passenger numbers. They struggled to follow the flow of people to the edge of the new car based suburbs, Paris and Tokyo managed to integrate their suburban railway networks with rapid transit underground lines. London has seen what such lines have to offer but has so far failed to match them. New York has not even tried.<\/p>\n<p>Public transport is not only an issue of numbers: operating it efficiently requires skill and sophistication, and an urban structure which favours it. New York for example, may have substantially more buses than London, but London makes better use of them; they carry more people, for more miles than in New York. The early archaeology of the underground lines left its mark on New York, as did the gaps between them. The same holds true for its three separate commuter rail networks \u2013 Metro North, the Long Island Rail Road, and NJ TRANSIT. While the system shrank substantially from the 1950s to the 1980s, the possibility of re-opening previously abandoned lines, especially in New Jersey is now an option while Metro North has plans to extend their Harlem and Hudson lines farther into Duchess County.<\/p>\n<p>It is only through the investment of vast sums of money in New York\u2019s transit systems that decades of decline were reversed. Since the early 1980s $30 billion, or more than $1.5 billion per year, 5,600 subway cars, upwards of 1,000 commuter cars and 4,300 buses have been either purchased or overhauled. The subway system has restored over 500 miles of track and refurbished over 60 stations. Of the $30 billion, just over half has been spent by the MTA for the NYC subway system, almost $1 billion per year for the 16-year period. The Port Authority has spent over $1.3 billion on PATH and the three commuter rail networks have used almost $10 billion to upgrade their capital plant. Over $3.1 billion has been spent on the bus networks in the two states.<\/p>\n<p>London is currently in the midst of an equally ambitious bout of investment in its transit services, though it has already achieved tasks which have thus far eluded New York such as connecting its main airport to the mass transit system. The questions both cities face are where to invest next \u2013 in terms of achieving the greatest return in urban terms \u2013 and how they will meet the long-term costs of financing these projects.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":null,"article_publishing_date":"February 2005","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"1","name":"Deyan","created":"2011-08-23 13:50:55","modified":"2013-10-23 12:14:25","slug":"sudjic-deyan","family_name":"Sudjic","title":"","email_address":"","photo_legacy":"\/0_images\/02-DSudjic.jpg","profile_text":"<p>Deyan Sudjic is the Director of the Design Museum in London.

Whyte plotted the movement of executive jobs from the city streets to isolated corporate campuses in the 1960s and 1970s and he explored the worrying tendency of such companies to implode shortly afterwards.<\/p>\n<p>He pointed to Union Carbide and American Can in particular that built themselves new corporate palaces that won architectural awards, but marked the last stage of their existence. The exurban location, he suggested, had the effect of isolating corporations from the face to face economy of the city, and thus further weakened companies that were already vulnerable. And he made a comparison with those companies that stayed<\/p>\n<p>behind and flourished, or even those who did make the move, but left behind a vestigial front office that grew more and more crowded as those executives who could, made the decision to stay. He could equally well have been talking about London, or Paris which experienced precisely the same movement as corporations attempted to capitalise on the land value of their city centre buildings.<\/p>\n<p>Whyte was describing an economy, and a city landscape that has changed beyond recognition in many significant aspects. But he posed a critical question about the relationship between the city, in its role as an accumulator of wealth, and its physical form. The Greenwich Stanford corridor \u2013 where so many of those corporations that resisted the tax incentives offered by a rattled New York City to stay ended up moving to \u2013 must be understood as just as much a part of the wider urban region of New York as Lower Manhattan. But in its physical form it is entirely different: low density, and with little physical infrastructure to permit the casual interaction which is the traditional quality of the city. In Whyte\u2019s view then, the exurban form is not one that can be said to sustain job creation in the sense that the dense urban model can. The developers who built the business parks were building jobs not cities. If they had built genuine cities, as it is arguable was the case in Canary Wharf, in London, then they might have built more long term jobs.<\/p>\n<p>Of course there are celebrated examples in other urban regions in which exurban agglomerations have turned into the kind of innovative clusters that have indeed generated jobs. Silicon Valley was the classic example. The reality is that a city as large and as complex as New York experiences both phenomena simultaneously. It has areas of exurban growth where companies go in search of space that costs less than the prime business areas of downtown. And even these areas could well learn from Whyte by exploring ways in which the physical structure might be modified so that it could begin to replicate at least some of the traditional qualities of urbanism that encourage those face to face transactions encouraged by the traditional city. But it also has areas in the inner core, such as the Garment District and Silicon Alley, which have proved important incubators for the growth of new jobs. However, this process has itself put at risk some of the traditional employment generators in these areas, especially those which have historically offered jobs within reach of the newcomers to the city, a segment of New Yorkers ever growing in its numbers.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":null,"article_publishing_date":"February 2005","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"1","name":"Deyan","created":"2011-08-23 13:50:55","modified":"2013-10-23 12:14:25","slug":"sudjic-deyan","family_name":"Sudjic","title":"","email_address":"","photo_legacy":"\/0_images\/02-DSudjic.jpg","profile_text":"<p>Deyan Sudjic is the Director of the Design Museum in London.

Focus areas were chosen for two main reasons: firstly, based on their relevance to the ongoing strategic discussion within each city; and secondly, because of their potential to inform a broader urban agenda. For all four topics, New York presents a complex and even contradictory picture, carrying over several problems from its former period of decline at the same time that it faces new issues and challenges brought about by its reinvigorated growth and unprecedented affluence.<\/p>\n<p>Labour market and work places | New York\u2019s enormous economic growth over the last 20 year has become one of the most apparent symbols of resurgent urban economies in the developed world. The city still benefits largely from its command and control functions in the global economy that contribute to the vitality of its FIRE (Finance, Insurance and Real Estate) sector and the wide array of specialized producer services linked to it. However, more contemporary discussions on New York\u2019s labour market also looked at the creative industries and their dependency on urban lifestyles on the one side, and at the future of urban manufacturing on the other. The investigation aimed to assess the relevance of both issues for other cities in similar development paths by recognizing New York\u2019s experience in dealing with them. The vibrancy of New York \u2013 manifested in increasing densities, intensity of land uses and sky-rocketing real estate prices \u2013 generates competitive pressures that threaten to displace sectors of urban manufacturing vital to the city\u2019s economy. Concrete examples of these sectors include the designers and manufacturers of Manhattan\u2019s Fashion District and even the new media entrepreneurs of Lower Manhattan\u2019s Silicon Alley, subject to the dynamics and needs of project-based work. Furthermore, there are conflicts between alternative land-uses and intense competition between industrial and residential uses in several areas in the outer boroughs. These areas include the rapidly changing Brooklyn neighbourhoods of Williamsburg and Greenpoint, where those seeking middle class housing proximate to their work in central Manhattan collide with existing industries and the gentrification pioneers connected to the design and art industries.<\/p>\n<p>Mobility and transport | The impact of New York\u2019s physical structure becomes nowhere as evident and measurable as within its transport system and mobility patterns where millions of metropolitan commuters need to be taken daily to the job-rich city\u2019s core. The most relevant characteristics of mobility in New York are first its reliance on public transport \u2013 the city accounts for almost half of all public transport use in the United States; and second the importance of walking as a fully developed mode of transport \u2013 this being almost exclusively a Manhattan phenomenon. Together with a general recognition of New York\u2019s success in turning around its historically decaying public transport system in recent decades, a criticism raised on local transport planning was its lack of vision of transports, private cars and walking as pieces of an interconnected system, and the need for more inter-modal strategies that include creative uses of sidewalks and other spaces for pedestrians. Combined, these issues raised the first relevant question for the wider focus of this investigation: Does the New York of today \u2013 seemingly the smartest American metropolis mobility-wise \u2013 offer solutions for the sustainable and energy efficient transport of tomorrow? On another level, New York\u2019s struggle to provide a continuous funding stream for operating its transit system but also to devise strategic inter-regional planning schemes leads to a the second question: What are the financing, management and development programmes needed to secure the continuous maintenance, upgrading and expansion massive and complex transport systems responding to the contemporary needs of urban living such as New York\u2019s?<\/p>\n<p>Public life and urban space | New York\u2019s comeback as a viable model of urbanity is perhaps best exemplified by the city\u2019s ability to rein in crime. As violence has waned and a growing feeling of security regained its streets and public places, criminologists identify a number of concurrent economic, cultural and demographic factors contributing to New York\u2019s receding crime epidemics. They remind us that there is a lot more to the city\u2019s turnaround than heightened policing and stricter measures of social control. This context of causal indeterminacy notwithstanding, neighbourhood responses and local strategies are clearly visualized in the built environments of some of the communities formerly or still affected by crime most severely. For this investigation, the case studies of the South Bronx and Brooklyn Red Hook were chosen. In the South Bronx, crime was controlled by the transformation of physical space; the attraction of long absent investment; and the raise of local stakeholder participation motivated by increasing homeownership and sustained home values. In the case of Red Hook the emphasis is rather placed in the transformation of socio-legal space and in making legal institutions visible to the community to build the local legitimacy of the law and engage citizens as stakeholders in the co-production of safety. A second focus within the public life investigation was New York\u2019s resilience in confronting the new threats of international terrorism and acts of massive urban destruction.<\/p>\n<p>Housing and urban neighbourhoods | Similarly to many other cities, New York is confronted with its need to accommodate its expanding population and generate higher residential densities, while preserving the character and liveability of its neighbourhoods. Housing is also in the crucible when the leading cultural and educational institutions of New York require additional land to grow and ensure the city\u2019s continuing international leadership in these fields. The plans for Columbia University\u2019s expansion in West Harlem, together with their discontents, illustrate the importance of adequate design in integrating institutions to an existing urban fabric in need of revitalization, and the challenges posed by the spatial juxtaposition of elite and disadvantaged communities. However, intervention is not limited to finding the right architecture or the best strategy in physical planning. City initiatives to increase New York\u2019s housing stock, especially its affordable brackets, are forced to weight in a number of concurrent factors such as: the right mix of regulatory safeguards of affordability and on the other hand incentives for developers to continue building highly needed new housing; the citywide benefits of allowing increased densities to accommodate demographic growth versus the localized costs of congested neighbourhoods and infrastructure requirements above existing capacity; and the need to balance the creation of new affordable housing with accessible jobs for residents to secure their livelihoods. These conditions are present in the discussions regarding the re-zoning and redevelopment plans for Williamsburg, their strengths as well as weaknesses and omissions.<\/p>\n<p>City Profile | In addition to the thematic investigation, a set of key statistics, maps and other relevant background information were provided to inform the conference debates and to serve as reference for the general public interested in a more in-depth knowledge of the cities related to the Urban Age project.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":null,"article_publishing_date":"February 2005","article_tags":false,"article_authors":false,"attachments":false,"gallery":{"slug":false,"extra_classes":"","slides":[]}},{"request_language":"","current_page_uri":"\/media\/search-dev.json","lang2_slug":false,"lang2_name":false,"parent_publication_id":2,"featured_image_uri":"","article_title":"New York: Public Life and Urban Spaces","permalink":"new-york-public-life-and-urban-spaces","article_subtitle":null,"article_abstract":"","article_summary":"","article_text":"<p>New York is the most European of America\u2019s big cities in at least one way.

Defining what makes a good city is more a matter of heart and soul than of engineering. It is more akin to an art than to a science. Yet, despite the subjective nature of urbanism, a government must adopt a vision and promote it, make decisions, build, define rules and enforce them \u2013 it must not only envision but also enact the city. If a good city is society\u2019s collective work of art, then its government acts as the piece\u2019s conductor and often its composer as well.<\/p>\n<p>Urbanism has to do with community and society decisions, enforced through some form of government. It is not possible to leave it up to private entrepreneurs whether there should be pavements or how wide they should be, how tall buildings should be, whether there should be parks and, if yes, where or how big they should be, and whether there should be a mixture of residential and commercial buildings. The fact that government intervention is essential, together with the reality that there are multiple possible designs for a city, makes urbanism one of the few remaining realms of ideology.<\/p>\n<p>In actual urban environments, Adam Smith\u2019s notion that individuals seeking their own benefit brings about the best for society as a whole is not always valid. An entrepreneur may want to build a high-rise building in the midst of a three-storey townhouse neighbourhood; but it is also a logical individual decision to drive to work in the comfort of one\u2019s private car, yet if all the residents of a large city were to do that, it would end in a traffic jam. Should the owner of rural land near a city be allowed to do whatever he wants with it, including, for example, use it to build a low-density gated community, far from the reach of public transport? How should scarce road space be distributed between pedestrians, bicycles, buses and cars? It would seem that public transport should be given priority over private cars in the allocation of road space, if democracy and the public good are to prevail.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_47\" style=\"width: 406px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/08\/04_SA08Ref_Penalosa2.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-47\" title=\"04_SA08Ref_Penalosa2\" src=\"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/08\/04_SA08Ref_Penalosa2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"396\" height=\"142\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Key transformations include the widely recognised success of the TransMilenio bus rapid transit system with dedicated lanes (left) to bring residents from outer areas to the city centre (middle) as well as the creation of new schools and libraries (right). Hundreds of new parks and pedestrian pathways have been created, making Bogot\u00e1\u2019s cycle networks \u2013 ciclorias \u2013 among the most extensive in the world.<\/p><\/div>\n<p>There are at least two types of equality we can realistically strive for in our time: the first is equality in quality of life, particularly for children. All children should have the same opportunities to develop their potential and be happy, have access to green spaces and play areas, to libraries and waterfronts. The second kind of equality \u2013 which is still within our reach \u2013 is to make truly effective the principle that the public good must prevail over private interest. The first article in every constitution stipulates that all citizens are equal before the law. Consequently, some state explicitly that the public good must prevail over private interest. In cities the interests of a few individuals often conflict with those of the community as a whole. It is the role of politics and governmental institutions to manage those conflicts and find ways of promoting inclusion and social justice.<\/p>\n<p>According to the United Nations, there will be nearly 2.8 billion new inhabitants in cities in developing countries over the next 40 years. Yet the growth of those cities will be more than proportional to their population growth for the following reasons: households will have fewer members and thus more dwellings will be needed for the same amount of people; more economic development means that institutional buildings take up a larger share of city space; and, people demand larger homes as their income grows. It is in cities in developing countries that many of the core urban and environmental challenges are concentrated in this century. And issues of equality and inclusion are particularly relevant there, as their societies are highly unequal. Inequality and exclusion can be even more painful than poverty, but the way we create and organise cities may be a powerful instrument in constructing equality and social justice.<\/p>\n<p>Public space dedicated to pedestrians can be a means to a more inclusive society. During work time the highest executive and the lowest-ranking employee may be equally satisfied or dissatisfied; in public space they both meet colleagues and do their jobs. It is only during leisure time that an abyss separates their quality of life. The upper-income executive goes home to a large house, probably with a garden, has access to sports clubs, country houses, restaurants, expensive cultural activities and trips abroad. The low-income person and his or her children live in a very small dwelling and the only alternative to television for spending their leisure time is public space accessible for pedestrians. Pavements, bicycle lanes, plazas, parks, promenades, waterfronts and sports facilities show respect for human dignity and begin at least to compensate for inequality in other realms.<\/p>\n<p>Access to green spaces may be the most formidable barrier to inclusion, not only now but also in the future. Until recently, few people believed the poor would own refrigerators, ordinary telephones, much less mobile ones, colour televisions, washing machines or sophisticated hi-fi systems, all of which are becoming common, even in lower-income homes in developing countries. Lower-income citizens will soon all have access to computers and a wide array of electronic equipment. What they will not have is access to green spaces and sports facilities \u2013 unless governments act today. Neglecting to acquire and secure open spaces today is not something that can be remedied easily in the future. It would be extremely difficult to purchase and demolish hundreds of buildings in order to create green spaces. And lacking such spaces severely affects quality of life, inclusion and as a result the legitimacy of social organisation. Beyond the basic public pedestrian space, which should be found throughout the city, a good city should have at least one, and ideally several, \u2018grand\u2019 public spaces. That is to say, spaces of such quality that even the wealthiest members of society cannot avoid frequenting them.<\/p>\n<p>A protected bicycle lane in a city in a developing country is a powerful symbol, showing that a citizen on a US$ 30 bicycle is as important as one in a US$ 30,000 car. A protected bicycle lane along every street is not a cute architectural fixture, but a basic democratic right \u2013 unless one believes that only those with access to a car have a right to safe mobility. Quality pavements and bicycle lanes show respect for human dignity, regardless of the level of economic development of a society. Many citizens in economically advanced societies cannot drive, because they are too young or too old, or because they have some kind of disability. A democratic city must be designed for the most vulnerable of its members. It is with regards to transport that governments have most dramatically failed to comply with democratic principles in cities in developing countries. There is a fight for the scarce road space between cars and public transport, pedestrians and cyclists; and there is a battle for public funds between car owners demanding more road infrastructure and lower-income citizens demanding schools, sewage systems, housing, parks and other basic infrastructures. The minority of car owners usually command the most political clout and thus direct public investment to road infrastructure aimed at reducing peak-hour traffic jams, leaving the needs of the poor unattended. Both urban and rural roads ignore or take poor care of pedestrians\u2019 and cyclists\u2019 infrastructure needs.<\/p>\n<p>There is no \u2018natural\u2019 level of car use in a city. Mature city governments such as those of Paris, New York, Tokyo, Berlin or London, explicitly or implicitly defined long ago that regardless of traffic conditions no more road infrastructure would be built in their core areas. Resources would be concentrated on public transport. If governments in Manhattan or Paris had built more and bigger roads, there would be increased car use in those cities. On the other hand, if these governments had built fewer or smaller roads, car use would have decreased there. In summary, it is the amount of infrastructure available for cars that determines the level of car use.<br \/> The governments of less-advanced cities are reluctant to make the inevitable decision: no more road infrastructure in the built city. Resources will be concentrated not on more or bigger roads but on creating, expanding and improving public transport. From then on, car use must be restricted explicitly through means such as number plate-based use restrictions, tolls, parking limitations; or implicitly, through traffic. Many advanced cities have seen famous citizen battles against urban motorway projects. One of the most high-profile is Jane Jacobs\u2019 fight against the Lower Manhattan cross-town expressway. In most advanced cities today \u2018transport policy\u2019 really means finding ways of achieving lower levels of car use and a higher share for public transport, cycling and walking. In cities in developing countries \u2018transport policy\u2019 still largely means the opposite: how to facilitate more car use. In societies in developing countries, where less than 50 per cent of households do not have a car, having one is held as a visible certificate of belonging to society\u2019s higher echelons. Upper-income people in less-developed and highly unequal societies tend to see using public transport alongside lower-income citizens as an affront to their position in society. Although they gladly use public transport when they travel to more advanced countries, they rarely go near it in their own.<\/p>\n<p>This partly because a city that makes too much room for fast- moving cars becomes less humane and loses quality of life, but also because road-infrastructure investments primarily benefiting higher-income citizens, redirect public funds away from schools, parks, housing and many other needs. The most vulnerable members of society, such as the poor, the elderly, children and disabled citizens, are not normally conscious of their interests and rights and do not have much political influence. A democratic government must act as their proxy and confront powerful minorities on their behalf. It must convince even upper-income groups that car-use restriction benefits them as well in the longer term. But in the end it must wield its decision-making power in order to implement its vision regardless of political costs. A frequent source of inequality is the division of cities or metropolitan areas into several, sometimes dozens of municipalities. Unfettered market forces create a situation in which expensive neighbourhoods for wealthier citizens attract similar high-income developments around them. Land around high-income developments tends to be expensive and normally low-income neighbourhoods will not be established there. The reverse is true too: a high-income housing development will not usually be developed next to a low-income one.<\/p>\n<p>A healthy, large city will have both low- and high-income groups. Higher-income groups provide tax funds to tend to the needs of lower-income groups. They pay high taxes and often do not even use many services provided by the city: they use private healthcare services and their children go to private nurseries and private schools. Municipalities with lower-income citizens have a greater need of social services provided by government, yet no possibility to muster the necessary funds to provide them. Inequality ensues. Blunt extraction of funds from wealthier municipalities in order to transfer them to lower-income ones does not solve the problem: it has been found that those who spend funds not generated by themselves tend to do so inefficiently. To make matters worse, poorer citizens with lower levels of education tend to be easy prey to demagogues and corrupt politicians.<\/p>\n<p>While there may be historical reasons for the existence of several municipalities within one city, once they are part of a large, modern metropolitan area there is little justification for them. Most citizens cross municipal borders unaware of their boundaries, except of course when the absurdity of such political subdivision is so extreme that public transport has to turn back at the border of the municipality, as happens in S\u00e3o Paulo. Long-term planning also becomes complicated when such subdivisions exist. Even the construction of a critical road artery or rail line becomes problematic. When different political parties control different municipalities, more problems arise, as has been the case in Mexico City. Bureaucratic expenses of many small municipalities are higher than those of one large one, and often the level of professional competence is lower within the smaller municipalities.<\/p>\n<p>For these reasons Canada has merged nearly 1,000 municipalities over the last decade, achieving more social justice, lower bureaucratic expenses and better long-term planning. In Johannesburg several municipalities were also merged after the end of the apartheid regime, in order to achieve greater equity. Higher-income citizens tend to oppose these mergers, as some of their funds will subsequently have to be redistributed to lower-income areas. Many small-town politicians also oppose them as they may end up in an unelectable position, or simply because they prefer to be, as the saying goes, the head of a mouse rather than the tail of a lion.<\/p>\n<p>Innovations are always difficult to implement. The status quo is maintained through a majority support, while ideas for change start with only a minority behind them. Government must act on behalf of the majority and also of the most vulnerable members of society, but it must also act on behalf of future generations. It is not possible for governments to provide all citizens with individual goods, yet it is possible to provide quality public goods and services: schools, libraries, transport and green space. Moreover, once citizens achieve a certain income level, it is easier to increase well-being through public goods than through private goods: through a concert hall, a green area, a waterfront.<\/p>\n<p>Inequality permeates everything around us so pervasively that it is difficult to differentiate between what is inevitable \u2013 or tolerable inequality \u2013 and that which could or should be altered. From today\u2019s perspective it seems that the social changes achieved by the French Revolution were obvious, almost natural, since the injustices redressed were so flagrant. However such injustices were not considered flagrant and not even evident before that moment in time. In the same way, we are often not aware of many cases around us in which the public good does not prevail over private interest. Investments in flyovers to minimise traffic jams for upper-income groups seem normal. The poor in the same city might lack schools or basic sanitation and sometimes even clean water, while private waterfronts, pavement-less streets and urban roads abound. If we were truly rigorous in applying the prevalence of the public good, cities in developing countries would ban private car use during peak hours. Only a minority would be affected. Most people\u2019s travel would take less time and there would be less air pollution; less road building and maintenance would free up public funds for better provisions for the needs of lower-income majorities.<\/p>\n<p>Most public policy discussions and decisions, such as those relating to macro-economics, are very short-lived. Even the most transcendental political events often do not affect people\u2019s lives as much as they are thought to. At the risk of appearing sacrilegious, it is for example irrelevant for the way people live today whether most countries\u2019 revolutions or wars of independence occurred 100 years earlier or later than they actually did. Instead, the way cities are built determines to a large degree citizens\u2019 quality of life for hundreds of years into the future.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":"http:\/\/v0.urban-age.net\/0_downloads\/archive\/_SA\/04_NewsPaper_Essay_Penalosa.pdf","article_publishing_date":"December 2008","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"4","name":"Enrique","created":"2011-08-30 10:11:50","modified":"2013-10-23 10:29:28","slug":"penalosa-enrique","family_name":"Pe\u00f1alosa","title":"","email_address":"","photo_legacy":"\/0_images\/02-EPenalosa.jpg","profile_text":"Enrique Pe\u00f1alosa, Mayor of Bogot\u00e1 1998-2001, is an urban strategist who advises cities.

The development of the &#8216;Family\u2019s Health Strategy&#8217; programme (the backbone of the National Health System), took place during a period of significant change in the country and its conception was heavily influenced by the WHO Alma Ata declaration principles of universality, inclusiveness and equity. The basic principles of the SUS are decentralisation and social participation.<\/p>\n<p>The Aten\u00e7\u00e3o Prim\u00e1ria \u00e0 Sa\u00fade (APS; Primary Health Care) is understood as a strategy of reorientation of the model of health care and can be defined as:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>A group of values: the right to the highest standard of health, solidarity and equity;<\/li>\n<li>A group of principles: governmental responsibility, sustainability and intersectoriality, meaning social participation; and<\/li>\n<li>A group that is inseparable from structural elements of the health services structure: access to first contact, integration, longitudinality, coordination, family and community guidance and cultural competence.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>According to the Pan-American Health Organisation (PAHO), Primary Health Care services should constitute the basis of any national health system, as it is considered to be the best strategy for producing sustainable improvements and greater equity in a population\u2019s health. In order to respond to the demands of the changes in the population epidemiologic profile, which now includes a growing prevalence of chronic diseases, the national health system in Rio de Janeiro has been focusing on better coordination between the different levels of attention and between various organisations. The consolidation of an integrated health care network is precisely the role that Primary Health Care services in Rio de Janeiro play.<\/p>\n<p>This integrated health care network is characterised by a defined territory and population, with a wide range of health institutions and services coordinated at the Primary Health Care level. The network is constituted by or coordinated with the use of electronic information systems, with a care model centred on the individual, the family and on the community\/territory, under a single and adequately financed management system<\/p>\n<p>The Municipality of Rio de Janeiro is situated in the southeast of the country, and has a population of some 6,320,744 inhabitants. The reform of the city&#8217;s health care system commenced in 2009, and was coordinated and organised by APS.<\/p>\n<p>In December 2008, family health care in the municipality reached just 3.5 per cent of the city\u2019s population\u00a0 (targeted through 62 family health teams). This figure increased to 26.1 per cent in October 2011 (478 complete teams providing access to health care for 1,649,100 inhabitants).<\/p>\n<p>Each family health team comprises one general practitioner, one nurse, one nursing technician, six community health workers and one community health invigilator, all of whom are responsible for approximately 3,450 people in the community. The team not only provide general health care for these individuals but also are responsible for maintaining the follow-up care of those patients who require access to other forms of health care, such as secondary care or hospital networks, on a long-term basis.<\/p>\n<p>In order to respect the principle of equity, this expansion of outreach by the family health care teams happened in a heterogeneous way and did not occur simultaneously. The areas with the greatest gaps in health care services, located in the west, were attended to first. The outreach of APS in those areas reached levels above 90 per cent, even in those areas furthest away from the centre.<\/p>\n<p>During this period, 43 new Primary Health Care units were built, increasing the total number of units in the city to 172. Important components were taken into consideration during the building of these units to foster both the motivation of the professional staff and to provide greater comfort for the service users. Some examples include better use of sunlight and air circulation within the units, energy-saving initiatives, and the use of rain water for gardens and toilets.<\/p>\n<p>In order to standardise the Primary Health Care provision for the city in August 2010 the portfolio of APS services was launched with a set of procedures that were to be utilised by all units according to their capabilities. The portfolio enabled APS not only to increase its services to the population but also the resolvability of each of the family health teams, making APS more widely accessible and less focused on procedures exclusively related to prevention\/promotion or, to the other extreme, to emergencies.<\/p>\n<p>A further mechanism that induced the improvement of quality of service in the APS network was the computerisation of every work centre in the family health units and the installation of electronic records. Since January 2011, this computerisation enabled the establishment of a payment system relating to the performance of each health care professional through two sets of variables: one for each health unit and one for each family health team, with quality indicators that look to improve the organisational system of the clinic. Part of the salary of the professionals (up to 10 per cent) can be made up of those two variables.<\/p>\n<p>Preliminary results showed a greater satisfaction with the provided services amongst the population, as access to health services widened, as well as among health professionals, who were more motivated to use good clinical practices. Furthermore, it is already possible to observe a decrease in hospitalisation rates for conditions more commonly treated by Primary Health Care, such as non-contagious chronic diseases. Results also showed a reduction in child mortality and from cardiovascular diseases, particularly in the areas with a greater expansion of Primary Health Care. A further result is the decrease in demand for emergency treatment in larger hospitals, which, in turn, have improved the services they provide for more serious emergencies. It is also evident that, in the community where the health units are built, there have been improvements in the urbanisation of the neighbouring regions. These include better mobility for people and income generation for many inhabitants in the neighbourhood, who end up working in the family health clinic. There is also indirect income generating improvements such as the creation of local businesses, which, in turn, results in the increase of value of housing in those areas.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/11\/2011_chw_5080_Dohman.pdf","article_publishing_date":"November 2011","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"135","name":"Hans","created":"2011-11-04 11:43:34","modified":"2011-11-04 11:43:34","slug":null,"family_name":"Dohman","title":null,"email_address":null,"photo_legacy":null,"profile_text":null,"organization":null,"role":null,"additional_affiliations":null,"qualifications":null,"staff_pages_blurb":null,"office_location":null,"display_after":null,"display_until":null,"extended_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb_lang2":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation_lang2":null,"phone_number":null}],"attachments":false,"gallery":{"slug":false,"extra_classes":"","slides":[]}},{"request_language":"","current_page_uri":"\/media\/search-dev.json","lang2_slug":false,"lang2_name":false,"parent_publication_id":36,"featured_image_uri":"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2012\/12\/transport-heading.png","article_title":"Public transport accessibility in world cities","permalink":"public-transport-accessibility-in-world-cities","article_subtitle":"","article_abstract":"","article_summary":"","article_text":"<section>\n<p><strong>City populations in walking distance of rail and metro stations<\/strong><\/p>\n<div><div id=\"attachment_3173\" style=\"width: 5106px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2012\/12\/AccessibilityBarChart.png\"><img src=\"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2012\/12\/AccessibilityBarChart.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"accessibility bar chart - mapping accessibility\" width=\"5096\" height=\"2485\" class=\"size-full wp-image-3173\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">This chart shows the proportion of metropolitan residents and jobs within 500 metres (5 to 10 minutes&#8217; walk) of rail, metro and bus rapid transit stations.

Amongst these numerous transformations, the relations between urban spaces, homes and city dwellers in cities like Rio de Janeiro are shifting profoundly and rapidly. In this city, famous for its dramatic topographical mixes of the natural and urban, the onus for mega-event development secured by unprecedented levels of foreign capital and investment, has led to hurried levels of extensive urban (re) development activity including a major port revitalisation project, far-reaching road works and Olympic infrastructure construction. While, improving the look and feel of the city to attract business investment and tourism in the run-up to and its aftermath (or \u2018legacy\u2019) of sporting mega-events has become one of these spectacles\u2019 defining features, the municipal mechanisms involved in achieving such goals can vary widely from place to place. <\/p>\n<p>In Rio, the desire to contain and \u2018clean up\u2019 the image of a Latin American city well-known for its highly visible socio-economic inequality \u2013 where formality and informality, abundance and scarcity, old and new, wood and cement live side by side \u2013 has led to sweeping controversial measures including the eviction and relocation of large swathes of the urban poor from their former precarious but relatively central homes to the periphery. The main reasons given for these relocations are the construction of new Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) lines; sports venue installations and upgrades; tourism-related infrastructure development and relocation from areas recently reclassified as geotechnically unsafe or environmentally dangerous. These market-driven transfigurations seen as necessary in producing a competitive \u2018world-class city\u2019, are generating new geographies of inequality and exclusion supported by an official discourse of social inclusion, participation and development \u2013 a contradiction that demonstrates both the voracity of present entrepreneurial city-visions and the enduring histories of interventionist pasts. <\/p>\n<p>When urban <em>favelas<\/em> first appeared, approaches towards their presence shifted between elimination and rehabilitation. This dualistic mode was made official during the early 1960\u2019s when, on the one hand, their large-scale removal and resettlement to distant low-cost housing complexes (<em>conjuntos habitacionales<\/em>) was promoted, and on the other, their permanence through resident participation, individual subsidies and provision of basic infrastructure was sought out. Until the late 1990\u2019s, the housing units built were few and mainly destined to the middle classes. They were also located in the city\u2019s periphery, with little consideration paid to transport modes, costs or travel time. Over time, these pushes towards opposing policy directions, underpinned as they were by strong electoral political interests, scarce (or badly managed\/distributed) resources, and the forceful crushing of what had once been a strong and robust anti-resettlement sentiment led to relative (albeit, shifting) levels of mainstream cultural tolerance towards <em>favela<\/em> existence and proliferation. Following a long period of disinvestment, urban reform gained ground in the national agenda during the 1980\u2019s and a significant number of housing programmes were instituted during the 1990\u2019s, culminating in the model 2001 \u2018City Statute\u2019 which, amongst others, establishes the need for effective participatory mechanisms in urban planning, development, housing management and institutionalisation. Despite the significant policy advances made during this period, including the strengthening of decentralisation, the explicit links to social inclusion and strengthening of a rights-based language, these developments did not prevent the recent contemporary revival in old <em>favela<\/em> \u2018extinction\u2019 efforts and methods. <\/p>\n<p>In Rio de Janeiro, up to thirty-seven communities and at least eleven thousand families have already been affected by evictions (or their threat) directly or indirectly linked to mega-event developments. Many more (up to 30,000) face similar consequences or are underway with the support of the flagship low-income housing project called <em>Minha Casa Minha Vida<\/em> (MCMV) \u2013 a federal construction programme devised by the Ministry of Cities under the 2008 federal Growth Acceleration Programme (PAC) to generate economic activity and increase the workforce. Resembling the mass modernist post-war public housing projects of the United States, this enormous project was planned in partnership with the federal states, local municipalities and private sector to accommodate means-tested families through owner-occupation. Its first two years (2009-11) saw the construction of 338,000 homes across Brazil with US$ 53M of investment and the creation of 665,000 jobs. The second phase (2011-14) hopes to construct 2 million units, 60% of which will be destined for low-income families. <\/p>\n<p>Like the early dichotomous approach to <em>favelas<\/em>, the resettlements supported by this programme and pursued as an inevitable consequence of housing need (estimated by the National Housing Plan &#8211; PlanHab to be around 7.9 million homes until 2023) are taking place alongside other \u2018in-situ rehabilitation\u2019 programmes like <em>Morar Carioca<\/em>, and urbanisation and legal regularisation programmes. In Rio de Janeiro, this \u2018Orwellian doublethink\u2019, similar to how Ananya Roy labelled similarly opposed urban interventions in India, framed within the discourse of \u2018holistic\u2019 Olympic legacy, is at once committed to the improvement and formalisation of all of the City&#8217;s favelas by 2020 while engaging in removal practices that tear at the seams of their established socio-economic networks, thereby unsettling the livelihoods of those that both leave and remain. This is particularly true when we take into account that 53.7% of employed Brazilians (in 2010) work in the informal sector. With women figuring as the larger percentage of this low-waged and precarious sector (mainly in domestic work) while continuing to bear the greatest burden of unpaid carework, their protection from arbitrary evictions and proximity to employment or income-earning opportunities become crucial. <\/p>\n<p>The negative housing impacts of mega-events have been widely debated amongst scholars and practitioners in relation to the South African World Cup and the Vancouver, Beijing and London Olympics. In Brazil, the legality, processes and results of evictions have been amply denounced by the UN\u2019s Special Rapporteur on adequate housing, on the national organisation \u2018<em>Comit\u00eas Populares da Copa<\/em>\u2019 and on other residents, local and international groups monitoring human rights violations associated to mega-events and the (in)action of their institutional and corporate sponsors. One of the main critiques levelled against the way resettlements are taking place in Rio today is that, despite the Municipal Law\u2019s (<em>Lei Org\u00e2nica<\/em>) statute that prohibits moving urban dwellers beyond a 7 km distance from their original homes, most though not all of these housing complexes are located as far as 50 km away in the <em>Zona Oeste<\/em> (West Zone). This region is an ever-expanding \u2018sub-central\u2019 frontier where cheap land can be quickly found, acquired and built on. Here, location is not just incidental, but central to the way the city is being imagined, elaborated and contested. <\/p>\n<p>The design of new BRT corridors appear to privilege access from the <em>Zona Sul<\/em> (South Zone) to \u2018high value\u2019 southwestern areas like Barra de Tijuca where many Olympic facilities are located and middle and upper classes are increasingly flocking to, while the problem of collective transport between the poorer resettlements and downtown remains unattended. The dire lack of urban infrastructure surrounding or connecting them can have a detrimental impact on residents\u2019 livelihoods, exacerbating the already existing imbalance between employment and housing opportunities. Such lack of infrastructure can also have negative implications for the municipality, as they carry the financial onus of urbanising the previously barren land. Moreover, lack of tenure or income mix may exacerbate social problems. The only distinguishable variations amongst new inhabitants are the places they came from and their reasons for arrival. And if rivalry existed in their places of origin, this could translate into new and violent territorial conflicts. Lack of established networks can also lead to the power vacuum filled by the control of militias and corrupt management practices at the expense of the residents. All of these factors, combined with poor financial modelling, basic and inflexible design, and lack of appropriate urban planning and integration are beginning to be highlighted.<\/p>\n<p>Such a case study where these coinciding mechanisms play out is <em>Morro da Provid\u00eancia<\/em>, a historic and primarily Afro-Brazilian <em>favela<\/em> facing on-going demolitions, relocations (692 announced) and in-situ upgrading as the large-scale <em>Porto Maravilha<\/em> revitalisation project takes place nearby. Modelled on international examples such as London\u2019s Docklands and Argentina\u2019s Puerto Madero and within the Olympic Games legacy plan, this grand-scale modernisation project intervenes in a 5 million sq. metre-area in the low and middle-class districts of Santo Cristo, Gamboa and Sa\u00fade to \u2018increase the city centre attractiveness as a whole and enhance Rio\u2019s competitiveness position in the global economy\u2019. \u0004Its opponents asked why residents are relocated far from the site when the municipality owns 75% of the central lands and buildings.\u0005 They argue that the currently underutilised structures can serve the need for affordable housing, especially as the site is already home to generations of poor working class populations. The construction of a cable car and a \u2018samba centre\u2019 connecting this hillside <em>favela<\/em> to two major tourist spots, led to the eviction of 140 families whose final destinations are unknown. Mainly, when the period preceding evictions is long and the future uncertain, this fearful waiting time that is often characterised by multiple pressures and coercion can lead to changes in residents\u2019 positions from actively resistant to cooperative. In these \u2018voluntary\u2019 resettlements, the element of \u2018free\u2019 choice becomes questionable. More precisely, it is about how the legitimate uses and users of newly valued central city spaces are being re-defined and delimited in a context of competing (and highly unequal) interests. <\/p>\n<p>When established territories are being disbanded, re-organised and relocated, a financial, social, but also an emotional void remains as lives and livelihoods are uprooted. While it is true that both the Ministry of Cities and Rio\u2019s municipal housing agency are evaluating their programmes to improve their functioning, if people\u2019s experiences and needs are not communicated into new formulations, the city runs the risk of perpetuating a disconnected, top-down form of planning that, in the short and long term, obviates the city\u2019s rich diversity. There is, at the moment, a conflict between \u2018the right to the city\u2019 and commercial purposes in the favour of the latter, as political will and financial pressures combine to the detriment of informal urban workers and dwellers. If delivering \u2018public good\u2019, in a phase of modernist upgrade, follows a voracious market-driven land policy, the city may run the risk of alleviating a social and economic segregation which will limit the much-needed access to decent and affordable housing.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":"","article_publishing_date":"October 2013","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"330","name":"Melissa","created":"2013-01-22 11:54:44","modified":"2013-10-29 16:44:02","slug":"fernandez-melissa","family_name":"Fern\u00e1ndez Arrigoitia","title":"","email_address":"m.fernandez1@lse.ac.uk","photo_legacy":"","profile_text":"","organization":"LSE London, London School of Economics and Political Science","role":"Research officer","additional_affiliations":"","qualifications":"BA\nMSc\nPhD","staff_pages_blurb":"<p>Dr. Melissa Fern\u00e1ndez Arrigoitia is a Research Officer at LSE London where she carries out investigations to do with the capital\u2019s social, economic and political life, particularly around housing issues.

Thus today most infrastructure follows city growth rather than facilitating and opening up new growth centres within and outside the city\u2019s core. In contemporary Mumbai, planning happens systematically \u2018posterior\u2019, as a recuperative and securing action. Perhaps globalisation and the urgency of integrating with a broader economic system are challenging the priorities of the governing authorities responsible for making the city? The case of the mill lands vividly illustrates the city\u2019s runaway physical growth. In the development of the area\u2019s 2.37 km2, located in the crowded central district of Parel, the economic gain of a select few has driven the conversion of this rare asset into private commercial development. Yet, despite being a vitally important and heavily publicised planning decision, no planning agency in Mumbai prepared a masterplan or strategy to integrate these lands for the benefit of the city; and concerned citizens, environmentalists and planners just reacted too late to salvage whatever could be retrieved through Public Interest Litigation (PIL) within a set of legislative moves to divide this prime land.<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">In sum, the mill lands demonstrate the state of the profession of urban planning and the culture of architecture in the city. Here, professionals and institutions are seemingly unequipped to grapple with emergent issues in the city. Thus, the profession is chiefly engaged in recuperative action, intervening post-facto to clean up the mess! It is therefore no coincidence that in Mumbai there is an increased celebration of projects involving \u2018cleaning up\u2019 \u2013 whether that is the restoration of historic buildings, precincts or districts, waterfronts and pavements, or the relocation of slums to make way for infrastructure. While critical to the functioning of the city, these projects are an indication of the limited role of the architectural and engineering professions as well as all the other agencies involved in making the city.<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">By default, the private sector is determining the emergent form of Mumbai. This is the result of a fundamental shift in the planning process whereby the government has privatised city development. And although the government has devolved itself of the responsibility of delivering urban amenities within a strategic framework, it has not defined its new role. Will it still be the custodian of the public realm or will it establish the checks and balances required for the unleashing of private enterprise for urban development? Today, there is an incredible disjuncture in the city between existing and allocated land use and the positioning of new infrastructure \u2013 a condition where land use, transportation planning and urban form have no relationships with each other in the emergent landscape. How then do growth, planning and vision for the city accommodate the future?<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">In order to evolve an approach relevant to this emerging scenario, there needs to be greater engagement with city issues by the citizens and professionals in the city. To allow this to happen, planning or decision-making about urban form should be addressed at two levels \u2013 the macro (or city) level and the micro or area\/neighbourhood level. In this model, akin to the state and concurrent lists at the national policy level, the macro level would concern itself with infrastructure, roads and connections between parts of the city as well as broad policies for the metropolitan area.<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">At the micro level, issues of urban form \u2013 floor space index (FSI) and transfer of development right (TDR) designations, aesthetics as well as health and hygiene \u2013 would enable city authorities to take responsibility for orchestrating growth in the region with the local level organisations (i.e. ward offices or citizens\u2019 groups) focused on the tactics for urban governance. This decentralised system would be far more efficient in managing as well as responding to crisis situations \u2013 like smaller pixels on a screen, we will get higher resolution in our cities on the ground.<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.urban-age.net\/0_images\/07_ref_Remarking%20Mumbai2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"175\" height=\"200\" align=\"right\" border=\"0\" \/>Cities grow and evolve by opening up new land for growth or recycling land within their domains. In both these processes, people affected must necessarily participate in the process if the decisions are to be sustainable. The misappropriation of the mill lands demonstrates that without this engagement, land becomes an abstract entity reduced to blobs of colour on a land use plan \u2013 open to change and manipulation. Cities by nature are contested territories. Who commands what and how in a Democracy is determined by who participates or is excluded from the process. It is crucial that a city has an articulated strategy for its growth and builds a consensus reflecting the aspiration of its citizens. In the mill lands, the state government and planning agencies sadly did not engage its citizens in the process of adapting this asset for future growth. In this context, the eastern waterfront is of great relevance to the city and the region, as their connection depends on how the eastern water\u2019s edge is recycled for use. In the regional growth scenarios and projections of the Golden Triangle (connecting Mumbai, Nashik and Pune), the eastern waterfront could connect the old centre with the regional triangle\u2019s emergent industries, special economic as well as agricultural export zones. This land also offers the potential to connect the peripheral areas of the city with the Metropolitan region as a whole.<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The eastern waterfront\u2019s approximately 7.3 km2 (1,800 acres) are grappling with great transformation as the economy of Mumbai moves into the post-industrial phase. While this area is roughly 3 times larger than the area of the mill lands, interestingly only 6 per cent of this land is under reservation by the BMC for public use with a meagre 0.85 per cent of open space. Thus the area\u2019s stretch of 14.5 km of virtually inaccessible waterfront offers the potential for public access while re-orienting the perception of the region with regard to the city\u2019s geography and physical form. Similarly, the potential for connectivity using water transport could offer the much-needed transformation of mobility within the region.<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Currently only 50 per cent of the land, 3.4 km2 (836 acres), is used for port activities. Large, seemingly underused infrastructure, roads and warehouses (often beautifully robust buildings with great reuse potential) create a sense of desolation that is offset by teeming populations, labour pools and a virtual sea of energy and resources creating new forms of employment in the area. Equally daunting is determining the process most appropriate to trigger the conversion of this incredible resource of land, people and infrastructure to improve the city while safeguarding the interest of present users? Indeed, the ecology of the region, defined by the mangroves and flamingos that settle here during half the year, couple with the heritage buildings and treasures such as the Sewri Fort and other fragments to comprise the rich fabric of Mumbai\u2019s Eastern Waterfront.<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The eastern waterfront is a crucial zone that could transform Mumbai and compensate for the city\u2019s many physical deficiencies. The challenge is how to rearrange the landscape to synergize these different components.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_164\" style=\"width: 658px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-164\" src=\"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/10\/RV-N-014a.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"648\" height=\"432\" \/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The dense mangroves at the Versova Creek are an important part of the city\u2019s fragile coastline and act as a buffer during high tide to help filter effluents discharged in the creek.<\/p><\/div>\n<p align=\"justify\">\u00a0<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":null,"article_publishing_date":"November 2007","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"47","name":"Rahul","created":"2011-10-07 14:46:07","modified":"2012-08-24 14:15:51","slug":"mehrotra-rahul","family_name":"Mehrotra","title":"","email_address":"","photo_legacy":"","profile_text":"","organization":"Department of Urban Planning and Design, Graduate School of Design, Harvard University","role":"Professor and Chair","additional_affiliations":"","qualifications":"","staff_pages_blurb":"<p>Rahul Mehrotra is a practising architect and educator.

The influential business think tank, McKinsey Global Institute, demonstrate that over the past decade Africa\u2019s average GDP growth rates have been climbing and inching closer to the levels commonly seen in South-East Asia until the global recession in 2008. They also underscore that between 2004 and 2008, return on investment in Africa was higher than in any other region in the world. In their bullish outlook, this signals the beginning of a long-term trend, which they evocatively brand as &#8216;lions on the move&#8217;. The other notable business think tank, Monitor Group, place cities at the centre of this optimistic storyline: &#8216;the economic future of SSA [sub-Saharan Africa] is more connected to the success of its cities, and the competitive clusters based there, than to its nation states. Cities today generate most of the subcontinent\u2019s wealth, with many thriving despite obvious challenges. Rapid urbanisation turbocharges economic growth and diversification, enhances productivity, increases employment opportunities, and improves standards of living.&#8217; Tellingly, both of these institutions and the panoply of multilateral development agencies agree that the one binding constraint on this pent-up potential is Africa\u2019s massive infrastructure deficit across all fronts.<\/p>\n<p>The World Bank produced an important body of work in 2010 that, for the first time, provides a comprehensive overview of the scale and dimensions of the infrastructural deficit across Africa, broken down to reflect both urban and rural aspects. The infrastructure diagnostic report pegs the overall infrastructure deficit at US$93 billion per annum. This is the level of annual investment required to address the current backlogs and cope with future growth. According to the same report, presently the level of annual investment peaks around $45 billion per annum, suggesting a massive shortfall, which of course means that the scale of future investment costs continue to climb well above the $93 billion estimate. The following table from the diagnostic report provides a high level summary of the sectoral composition of the infrastructural deficit, without disaggregating it between urban and rural areas.<\/p>\n<p>It is important to read this table in relation to the dramatic prevalence of slum living conditions across most African cities, which, according to the last State of African Cities Report, stands at 62 per cent. Moreover, the 2008 State of the World\u2019s Cities Report demonstrated that not only does Africa have a much higher slum prevalence level (62 per cent), but also that the depth of deprivation is also much more acute compared to South-East Asia and Latin America. In other words, of the four dimensions of slum living: overcrowding, informal housing, insecure tenure and lack of access to water and sanitation, 37 per cent of slums in Africa have three to four of these conditions, compared to 5 per cent in Southern Asia and 8 per cent in Latin America. One of the central drivers of poor health and well-being is of course the absence of water and sanitation along with overcrowding and precarious living environments. However, apart from recognising the low levels of access to basic services such was electricity, water and sanitation, it is also stark that where these services are provided, they barely reach the two top quintiles of the population. The bottom 60 per cent is simply not reached because the modalities of finance and delivery are driven by the imperatives of cost-recovery and the prioritisation of economically important spaces: nodes of commerce and movement of goods and services and the residential estates that house the middle classes and elites. Tellingly, this approach is characterised and lamented by the WHO as evidence of, fundamentally, the unjust and unequal distribution of resources, wealth, information and power in these societies.<\/p>\n<p>There is a particular view of the world, cities and the role of the market that underpin a growing confidence that Africa\u2019s cities are finally being recognised as critical anchors for the overall economic renaissance. At the risk of crudifying a number of complex processes and perspectives, my stylised account would suggest a new urban policy dogma that goes something like this: if Africa is to take its place in the global economy, it must urgently address the critical infrastructure deficits in energy, connective infrastructure (roads, rail, ports, airports, ICT) and water. These fundamental economic infrastructures can then catalyse larger processes of economic development that will raise land values and the asset base of local authorities, which can then recoup its investment through taxation, which along with national transfers, can be used to address the massive problems associated with slum urbanism. However, this virtuous loop depends on appropriate regulatory reform which includes, inter alia, decentralisation of built environment functions and fiscal powers to cities, easing the cost of doing business to attract more foreign direct investment, and suitably secure and networked residential stock for the middle-classes and entrepreneurs that will drive these new investments and businesses. The resulting revenue that stems from creating this &#8216;enabling environment&#8217; for economic development can then be deployed to fund and progressively expand a sensible slum upgrading programme, which fosters the connection between enhancing aggregate economic growth and raising everyone\u2019s living standards by providing access to essential services in the most disconnected areas of the city.<\/p>\n<p>Within the logic of this mainstream policy mindset, the primary obstacles to the realisation of this agenda are foremost a lack of political will, which can be traced to a reluctance to devolve powers to cities and a deeper underlying fear that cities will in due course breed political opposition. Consequently, political elites tend to ignore the pressing importance of rapid urbanisation and its attendant demands for substantial infrastructural investments. As a result, in many official policy documents there is tenor of frustration and desperation with most African government who simply fail to do the bare minimum to come to terms with the material realities of urbanisation and its economic, social, technological and political imperatives. There is clearly some truth to this line of analysis. However, my contention is that the new urban policy canon for Africa is undermined by a number of more fundamental conceptual problems.<\/p>\n<p>There is very little acknowledgement that with the low economic base, combined with massive demographic expansion over the next 40 years or so, large-scale structural disconnect from the formal economy, and already very high levels of income inequality, slum living will remain a defining feature for the foreseeable future. In the mainstream urban policy approach there is seemingly little appreciation for the cumulative consequences of poverty and ill-health if slum living conditions are allowed to remain as high as they are. In fact, there is little evidence that the overall negative economic impacts as large-scale poverty exacerbates social conflict and undermines economic productivity. The continuation of slum urbanism as the dominant material condition in African cities is informed by fascinating and grim forecasts in African Futures 2050, published by the Pardee Centre and the Institute of Security Studies. According to the study, &#8216;Over the entire half-century [1960\u20132010], Eastern Africa gained only about $150 per capita and Western Africa about $130 per capita, while GDP per capita in Central Africa has remained almost unchanged since 1960.&#8217; This is an unfathomable accomplishment of economic, political and social failure. Looking ahead to 2052, an even larger and more dramatic process of systemic exclusion will potentially eclipse this inventory of failure across most African countries. The income poverty trend lines and projected GDP per capita shifts that stem from this work are instructive (see Figures 1 and 2).<\/p>\n<p>In reflecting on Figure 2 it is important to understand that both the East and West African regions will more than double their populations over this period, from roughly 300 million in 2010, to 700 million by 2050, respectively. Keeping this prospect of interminable poverty in mind, it is sobering to remember that presently slum prevalence is almost 62 per cent. The forecast data and speculation seem to suggest that Africa will double its population by 2052, moving from 1.1 billion in 2011 to 2.3 billion; and an urban share of 40 per cent in 2011 to one approaching 60 per cent by 2052.<\/p>\n<p>A reasonable conclusion to arrive at where these trend lines meet is that urban poverty, ill-health and associated slum urbanism will continue to be a major feature of city life for at least the next four decades. It is difficult to place store in the policy thinking of the World Bank, and various other multilateral development agencies, as far-reaching enough to effect a dramatic departure from current patterns. There seems to be an unshakable, if even irrational, belief that rational government with sufficient commitment will can get a handle on the problem and systematically introduce effective planning, regulation and management to ensure the virtuous circle of development, in the parlance of the Africa Infrastructure report. Such a misplaced perspective fails to engage with the cumulative effects of informalised economies, settlements, social-cultural systems and political cultures. Figure 3 offers a stylised account of the fundamental logic that drives urban development patterns in most sub-Saharan African cities in order to signal the systemic nature of informal urbanism.<\/p>\n<p>Moreover, the World Bank perspective definitely fails to engage with the robust analysis of the WHO that suggests the persistence of slum living and associated poor health conditions and outcomes can be traced to the distribution of power in cities and society at large. It is relevant to quote the major report of the Commission on Social Determinants of Health established by the WHO at some length: &#8216;The poor health of the poor \u2026 are caused by the unequal distribution of power, income, goods, and services, globally and nationally, the consequent unfairness in the immediate, visible circumstances of people&#8217;s lives \u2013 their access to health care, schools, and education, their conditions of work and leisure, their homes, communities, towns, or cities \u2013 and their chances of leading a flourishing life. This unequal distribution of health-damaging experiences is not in any sense a &#8220;natural&#8221; phenomenon but is the result of a toxic combination of poor social policies and programmes, unfair economic arrangements, and bad politics. Together, the structural determinants and conditions of daily life constitute the social determinants of health and are responsible for a major part of health inequities between and within countries.&#8217; Interestingly enough, in proposing a way out of this, the Commission falls back on the idea of a strong, independent, capable, and one could argue, generous state. There is surprisingly little in the work of the Commission on what is to be done when this kind of developmental and interventionist state is simply unlikely for a variety of historical and material reasons.<\/p>\n<p>In placing most of the burden for improving health outcomes on the shoulders of the state, admittedly working in partnership with civil society and the private sector, there is an insufficient grappling with central and vital roles of various categories of civil society organisation in shifting the political economy of slum urbanism at the level of the street, the household and the intimate neighbourhood scale. In my reading the only way that the vicious circle illustrated in Figure 3 can be interrupted, deconstructed and remade into a new urban logic is if civil society organisations, rooted in the interest of the urban poor, can articulate an effective package of economic, governance and political-cultural reforms, rooted in a plurality of local experiments and dogged mobilisations. At this point it is important to steer clear, even if for a while, from the morally driven discourses on participatory development and virtuous civil society organisations. In fact, it is in thinking through a new imaginary for urban civil society that the work of urban theorists such Asef Bayat, Ananya Roy, AbdouMaliq Simone and Mark Swilling come into its own.<\/p>\n<p>The first step in breaking through to a compelling theory on African and Southern urbanism is to develop a deep theoretical and philosophical appreciation for the unique lived dynamics of an urban logic and patterning that continues to grow and adapt despite the absence of the conventional underpinnings of industrial modernism. This enterprise is large, complex and demanding in its own right and deserves dedicated exponents. This larger enterprise of reimagining urbanism is an entry point, a gateway onto understanding alternative organising logics and energies. The fundamental intellectual, policy, design and artistic challenge confronting (African) urbanists is to draw out the logics, emergent dynamics and aesthetics of everyday urbanisms, and connect those with normative imperatives to squarely address the dramatic injustices that I touched on before. By force, this will require a savvy understanding of dominant market logics in the shaping of cities, but this is merely to understand and pinpoint an alternative positioning.<\/p>\n<p>This new, different, alternative vantage point must be the adaptive livelihood imperatives of poor households. Building on the rich work of John Friedmann on whole economies, circa 1992, it is possible to layer and articulate three economic facts of life that cut across poor settlements: social economies, informal economies and formal economic systems. These are not iron-clad categories for they are mutually constitutive and dependent, but also overlapping in the routine reproduction of settlements and household survival strategies. Given the predominance of unemployment and informality, the most urgent and critical alternative vision we need is to systematise our thinking on the nature and function of social economies.<\/p>\n<p>An agenda for the role of social economies can be organised around a large-scale community-focused public works programme trained on the following: the care economy, including localised health and education support services; ecological system services as manifest in green and blue infrastructures; cultural and artistic services for the youth and children; and classic public works programmes centred on road building, school building, and continuous maintenance and repairs of these institutions along with clinics, early childhood centres, transport interchanges, and so forth. An example from South Africa may be apposite. Amongst the youth demographic, more than 50 per cent cannot access formal jobs even though they may have completed primary and portion of secondary schooling. At the same time, South Africa has the largest HIV\/Aids prevalence rate in the world. In order to contain and manage the scale of the Aids pandemic, it is vital that a national network of home-based care workers be established. These care-economy service workers need not necessarily have a formal medical training but must work with affected households to ensure that anti-retrovirals are taken in conjunction with sufficient nutritional intake, as well as various kinds of psychological support to help sufferers and their families deal with stigma and shame. Since nutrition is such an important aspect of these localised support systems, these community workers can also serve as linchpins with various food security initiatives that combine the imperatives of urban agriculture, with restoring green infrastructures and enrolling children and older persons in various handcrafts that can restore connections with soil and effectively, hope.<\/p>\n<p>For such an initiative to flourish it requires two vital resources: committed activists to take ownership of these programmes at a neighbourhood level, and taking responsibility for embedding such programmes within a community-driven spatial vision that in turn is translated into specific fine-grained interventions that will gradually and determinedly improve living and economic environments, especially collective public spaces that flow with and from public transport arteries. Such dynamics of course assume a generalised awareness about the importance of spatial and design literacy refracted through local idioms, sensibilities and desires. The second ingredient is an institutional context that can facilitate systematic maturation of adaptive systems and projects, which in turn is the basis for scaling up social processes and institutions that can transform the quality of life and aspiration in these seemingly marginal and hopeless settlements.<\/p>\n<p>On this point I concur with Arjun Appadurai and Marty Chen that the social technologies of slum movements, street vendors, waste pickers and so on, offer vital clues about alternative organisation and governance systems. These institutional innovations are vital to articulate the interests of the urban poor into the heart of global, national and city-level boardrooms of power where the traditional calculations about urban growth and investment are unreflexively enacted. At the heart of these new generation social movements is the idea of a &#8216;social-cultural operating system&#8217; and technology that addresses the profound material and economic needs of the urban poor through a strategy premised on empowerment through collective action. However, against a backdrop of long-term political and market failure, an ethnic and sensibility of autonomy accompany their approach. Nothing is expected from the state. Nothing is anticipated from the formal private market. Instead, residents club together in various assemblages to try to make their minimal incomes stretch further by leveraging each other\u2019s support, intelligence and labour to gradually but systematically move everyone forward. At the core of the intelligence system is a capacity for cannibalising, subverting, appropriating and recasting the resources and expectations of the formal city of government regulation and private ownership.<\/p>\n<p>In closing, my central thesis is that the future of African urbanism will be shaped by the logics of official outlooks and resources that drive large-scale economic infrastructural investments and generally reproduce the predominant inequalities that mark our cities. Our cities will also be shaped by the routine actions of the urban majorities that continue to be excluded and ignored in the analytical and risk registers of powerful actors. However, as the century unfolds, and new kinds of social movements refine their social technologies, combined with the benefits of cheap digital technologies mediated by mobile telephony, and enact and articulate their spatial visions for their settlements \u2013 the real city \u2013 we will see incredibly dynamic, contested and surprising urbanisms emerge. I have no doubt that the street, the slum, the waste dump, the taxi rank, the mosque and church will become the catalysts of an unanticipated African urbanism. So, let\u2019s pay attention in our quest to better understand the determinants and drivers of well-being in the heart of the city \u2013 the slum.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/11\/2011_chw_5060_Pieterse.pdf","article_publishing_date":"November 2011","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"129","name":"Edgar","created":"2011-11-04 11:39:16","modified":"2013-10-23 12:02:55","slug":"pieterse-edgar","family_name":"Pieterse","title":"","email_address":"","photo_legacy":"","profile_text":"Director, Centre for Cities in Africa, University of Cape Town.","organization":"African Centre for Cities, University of Cape Town","role":"Director","additional_affiliations":"","qualifications":"","staff_pages_blurb":"<p>Edgar Pieterse is holder of the DST\/NRF South African Research Chair in Urban Policy.

By almost every measure, the obligations of hosting the games have multiplied. In the century following the \u201crebirth\u201d of the modern Olympic Games, the number of sports represented on the Olympic program expanded from nine in Athens 1896 to 28 in London 2012; over the same period, the number of medal events grew from 43 to 302. As more countries joined the Olympic Movement, the number of athletes participating rose from 241 to over 10,500. In tandem with this growth, the number of coaches, referees, judges, and operational staff increased, as did the \u201cOlympic family\u201d made up of officials from the IOC, the International Federations (IFs), the National Olympic Committees (NOCs), and the Organizing Committees of the Olympic Games (OCOGs), as well as a ballooning contingent of sponsors, media and broadcast professionals, and local volunteers. Rounding out the program are the spectators, whose numbers were estimated to approach 11 million over the duration of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games in London 2012.<\/p>\n<p>A form of Olympic sprawl now accompanies this burgeoning Olympic program, leading to changes in the size and composition of infrastructure required to accommodate the games. Over the past century, building for the summer games has evolved from a single stadium to large complexes encompassing multiple venues, as well as housing for thousands of athletes and members of the media, ceremonial parks, broadcast and press centres, all connected by transportation facilities capable of moving hundreds of thousands of spectators each day. For the first Olympiad in Athens 1896, only seven venues were needed, including a renovation of an ancient stadium, and other existing facilities such as the Athens Tennis Club and the Bay of Phaleron for swimming events. Over the past fifty years, the number of sports venues used by host cities averages just over 30 facilities, with 38 venues in use for Barcelona 1992, 29 venues for Sydney 2000, and 31 for London 2012.<\/p>\n<p>In providing Olympic infrastructure, host cities are contractually obligated first and foremost to the technical requirements of a set of main stakeholders. These include the IOC, particularly its executive board, the International Federations (IFs) who govern individual sports and their sub-disciplines, the National Olympic Committees (NOCs) who sponsor and represent the athletes from their country; and the local organising committee for the Olympic Games (OCOGs) who govern the delivery of the games, and manage relationships among these parties, including the host city and other levels of government for a specific Olympiad. These stakeholders, particularly the IFs, can determine whether existing facilities pass technical muster, and in so doing, have a good degree of influence on the amount of new construction required and the cost of venues. Depending on how ticket and broadcast revenues are shared, different stakeholders can seek to influence the spectator capacity of a given venue, rendering existing facilities with small fixed seating capacities as unusable for the games. <\/p>\n<p>The IOC, for its part, is aware of the increasing scale of the summer games, and the impact on host cities. Colloquially referred to as concerns over \u201cgigantism\u201d in IOC documents, the IOC has led efforts to reign in the scope of the Olympic program. For example, the IOC has limited the number of sports to 28, the number events to approximately 300, and the number of athletes to approximately 10,500. If form follows function, then ideally, limiting the scope of the program should result in a smaller footprint. Again, the IOC, with input from the IFs and NOCs, provides prospective host cities with some guidance about the expected number of venues, capacity requirements, and planning dimensions, based on the 28\/301\/10,500 formula. For example, in the late 1990s, the guidelines for the minimum surface area of the games estimated a total footprint of approximately 671 hectares or 1660 acres.<\/p>\n<p>The import and impact of this theoretical minimum footprint in part depends on the size of the host city, and the extent of its \u201ccity proper\u201d. In Barcelona, a comparatively small city with a surface area of 10,360 hectares in the city proper, this 671 hectare footprint represents approximately 7 per cent of its total area. In a large city, such as Beijing with a surface area of 75,109 hectares, the footprint shrinks to comparatively miniscule 1 per cent. Of course, what is required is often different from what is built. This minimum Olympic \u201ctemplate\u201d is net of elements such the large-scale public spaces and ceremonial green spaces that are often included as part of the main complex designs, nor do they include parking areas or allowances for transportation facilities. In Beijing, the total footprint of the 2008 Olympic Games is estimated at approximately 3,400 hectares \u2013or 5 per cent of its total land area \u2013 including 1,215 hectares for the Olympic Green, 680 hectares for the Olympic Forest Park, and 80 hectares for the Olympic Village. Albeit an imperfect metric, since some facilities are located within the city proper and others are not, it remains clear that if the average footprint of the Olympic Games and its attendant infrastructure averages around 5 per cent of its host\u2019s total surface area, it is a significant use of urban land. Of course, location can trump scale, particularly when Olympic facilities are sited in areas with more important and strategic long-term uses.<\/p>\n<p>Given the objective of reducing the scale of the Olympic Games as a means to reducing its cost and complexity, it follows that an important step is to rethink the size and composition of its infrastructure. Sports venues are the primary determinant of the scale of the Olympic footprint  in an equation where the number of venues is a function of the number of sports, disciplines (branches of sports), events, and participants. The constraint of the three-week duration often makes it necessary to provide multiple versions of a single venue type \u2013proposals to extend the length of the games have not succeeded. For example, several indoor facilities (including gymnasiums, arenas, and halls) are required to accommodate events such as gymnastics, fencing, judo, and weightlifting.  Similarly, more than one pool is typically needed to accommodate the four disciplines within the sport of aquatics: swimming, diving, water polo, and synchronized swimming. The type of sport to be accommodated also influences venue provision, particularly as the Olympic program has diversified to accommodate new sports and disciplines, such as BMX cycling, canoe\/kayak slalom, and beach volleyball.   <\/p>\n<p>Whether these sports venues are overlaid onto existing facilities, built new, or provided temporarily, also influences the scale and cost of hosting the games. Among recent host cities, the average number of existing venues used is just over 50 per cent, though in most cases these existing venues required modifications to accommodate Olympic events. Temporary facilities are also gaining favour, particularly for outdoor, grass-based sports with lower spectator demand, such as archery, shooting, and equestrian events. They are attractive primarily because of their cost basis, estimated at approximately one-half to one-third less than building new. Theoretically, the use of temporary facilities also allows host cities to make choices about matching the need for permanent venues with local sports preferences. Less direct, but perhaps more important, temporary facilities eliminate the spatial opportunity cost of occupying urban land for low demand land uses. Beijing 2008, London 2012, and Rio de Janeiro 2016 all make use of temporary facilities. Rio plans to use 35 competition venues, of which 7 are intended to be temporary, and 18 are already existing, though many were built for previous mega-sporting events over the past decade, including the Pan Am Games in 2007 and FIFA World Cup in 2014. <\/p>\n<p>Viewed from the perspective of host cities, then, reducing the cost of delivering the Olympic Games is very much a function of the scale of its infrastructure, particularly the sports venues. As the cost of providing these \u201cOlympic infrastructures\u201d spirals to unprecedented levels, widespread criticism has emerged concerned that host city spending outpaces \u2013and in some cases replaces \u2013public investment in traditional projects such as highways, schools, and hospitals. Public perceptions about the cost of the Olympic Games is confused by the peculiarities of Olympic accounting, where most games are announced to \u201cbreak even\u201d from an operations perspective: That is, games-time revenues through ticketing, sponsorships, and broadcast revenues typically exceed games-time operations expenses such as accommodation, food and beverage, transportation, and security. Capital expenditures are far greater than the games-time operating budget, and include spending on sports venues, Olympic villages, media facilities and so forth, and are accounted for separately from the reckoning that determines the financial success or failure of a particular games. Moreover, these costs are the sole responsibility of host cities, and host governments must guarantee their provision as part of the host city contract.   <\/p>\n<p>In this context of increasing scale, cost and complexity, why do cities want to host the Olympics? For most aspiring host cities, investment in Olympic infrastructure is often viewed as means to leveraging the games for broader economic growth and urban redevelopment. The appeal of building Olympic infrastructure lays in its potential to improve the city\u2019s brand image, and to stimulate new private investment that in turn fosters job creation, generates new tax revenues, and revitalizes targeted urban areas. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has embraced this notion that host city investments in Olympic infrastructures should be positioned as part of a broader urban agenda, through widespread rhetoric that asks its bidding cities to create an Olympic \u201clegacy\u201d. Many host cities, hoping to impress the IOC during the bid process, and to capitalise on the accelerated timeline and high energy of Olympic efforts, have bundled games infrastructure within larger urban strategies. Yet the promise of the Olympic Games as a catalyst of widespread urban development has routinely fallen short, leaving the IOC and its host cities under pressure to better balance the costs and benefits associated with building infrastructure for the games. London 2012 positioned the games within an extraordinarily effort to redevelop the Lower Lea Valley in East London, a strategy whose impacts will take years to fully comprehend.  <\/p>\n<p>Host cities can reduce the cost and scale of delivering the Olympic Games by more carefully monitoring the Olympic program for policies that imply a larger number of venues, or an increasing number of specialized venues.  Host cities might also coalesce to have their interests represented in Olympic program deliberations, and to share information and knowledge more directly.  Reducing costs also requires careful choices about new venues over existing, or permanent venues over temporary. The IOC, for its part, also has a strong interest in recalibrating the infrastructure required of host cities, since the viability of its mission, and its political power, is predicated on strong candidate pool. Over the past twenty years, the quantity of host cities bidding for the games has not markedly decreased, but the composition of cities in the bid pool now includes a larger proportion of cities located in emerging markets as well as smaller cities, as more established world cities forgo the opportunity to serve as Olympic host cities, in part based on increasing financial and political risk.  To support the long-term viability of the Olympic Games, efforts to recalibrate the scale of this Olympic urbanism, and to reduce the obligations of host cities with regard to the provision of Olympic infrastructure should be an ongoing priority of the IOC and the global urban policy community.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":"","article_publishing_date":"October 2013","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"443","name":"Judith","created":"2013-10-21 19:08:23","modified":"2013-10-21 19:08:23","slug":"grant-long-judity","family_name":"Grant Long","title":"","email_address":"","photo_legacy":"","profile_text":"Judith Grant Long is Associate Professor of Urban Planning at the Harvard University Graduate School of Design.

During this period, the city felt the nationwide impacts of unemployment, \u201cinformalisation\u201d of labour, poverty, violence, increases in the number of slums, urban degradation, and violence. The neo-liberal political experiments of the 90\u2019s maintained and exacerbated this situation.<\/p>\n<p>The evidence of the city\u2019s decline can be summarised in few figures: between 1989 and 1997, 22% of the industrial companies transferred to other regions of the country; in 1970, nine of the largest Brazilian banks had their headquarters in the city, but by 1991 only five remained; the Rio de Janeiro Stock Exchange transferred to S\u00e3o Paulo, joining BOVESPA; and in the 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s, the population living in the slums increased at the rates of 2.6% and 2.5% per year. This has been a long cycle of about 25 years of urban and economic decline, as well as the corrosion of the city\u2019s social fabric. Fear and uncertainty became distinctive traits of the city\u2019s daily life.

Rio de Janeiro simply became a giant inner city of 6 million inhabitants.<\/p>\n<p>Rio\u2019s \u201cmiracle\u201d took place by the second half of the 2000\u2019s. As of 2005, a spectacular cycle of urban regeneration began, led by three factors: the awarding of Brazil and the city to host the 2014 World Cup and the 2016 Olympic Games; the return of national economic growth, allowing for more dynamic international trading; and the resumption of the State\u2019s inducing role and the consequent expansion of public spending. At the same time, an urban coalition between previously conflicting parties emerged in the city, involving the different levels of government. This coalition implemented a governance model based on the design of urban entrepreneurship and set a strategy to transform the inner city into a global one, with the attributes of a city with the conditions to successfully participate in the interurban competition for global business flows. From a symbol of the structural problems of the Brazilian capitalist development and its crisis, Rio de Janeiro has transformed itself into the image of a successful Brazil, its economy takes-off towards an inflexion of its traditional standard of development combining economic expansion, formalization of employment, real increase in work income, decrease in social inequalities and poverty. Major public works trigger the expansion and upgrading of urban infrastructure, with the construction of new subway lines, new forms of urban mobility (BRT, LRT) and the renovation of the road system. Central areas hitherto degraded due to a long-term neglect by the government are subject to extensive urban renewal projects. Self-esteem, business and quality of life are regenerated. Thus, the city seems to resume its historical calling as &#8220;the marvellous city&#8221;, a myth cherished by the inhabitants of a tropical urban paradise. \u201cRio\u2019s miracle\u201d puts Rio de Janeiro into the current academic trend, as a successful experiment of the entrepreneurial governance model and urban policies guided by the objectives of the promotion of quality of life as a force that attracts business into the city.<\/p>\n<p>It turns out, however, that if something is successful, it takes place in the shadows of a huge inner city shaped by the metropolitan periphery of Rio de Janeiro, with 19 other cities that hoard 5.5 million forgotten inhabitants. Rio de Janeiro is actually a mix of city and metropolis consisting of a densely urban territory, which is strongly unified by its job market and the urban needs of its inhabitants, but crisscrossed by artificial municipal boundaries. Among the 52 metropolitan areas in Brazil, Rio de Janeiro is the one with the highest degree of internal integration, according to the results of a study conducted by the <em>Observat\u00f3rio das Metr\u00f3poles<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>The map below shows this feature of Rio de Janeiro as a mix of city and metropolis. It conveys the functional territory of the metropolis, which in addition to being heavily integrated, is marked by extreme differences in quality of life. For example, in the municipalities of the metropolitan periphery only 46% of the population has access to sanitation services that are connected to the public sewage system.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2013\/10\/rio-de-janeiro-the-forgotten-mix-img00.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-5605\" alt=\"Integration level of municipalities - According to Rio de Janeiro's Metropolitan Dynamic\" src=\"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2013\/10\/rio-de-janeiro-the-forgotten-mix-img00.png\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Integration level of municipalities &#8211; According to Rio de Janeiro&#8217;s Metropolitan Dynamic<\/p>\n<p>In addition to the urban conditions of life, the metropolitan region is also marked by the pronounced inequalities of present and future opportunities. Such is the case of children and young people\u2019s access to basic education. The city of Rio de Janeiro has the most universal network of public and private schools in terms of meeting the needs of the population, in addition to becoming one of the most effective school systems. That is what quantifies the IDB-Basic Education Development Index. The interpretation of the graph highlights the asymmetry between the networks of cities that make up the metropolitan periphery and Rio de Janeiro\u2019s.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2013\/10\/rio-de-janeiro-the-forgotten-mix-img01.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-5606\" alt=\"IDEB \u2013 Index of Basic Education Development \u2013 (2005-2011)\" src=\"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2013\/10\/rio-de-janeiro-the-forgotten-mix-img01.png\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>IDEB<sup>1<\/sup> \u2013 Index of Basic Education Development \u2013 (2005-2011)<\/p>\n<p>Not only did we see the gap between the performance of the municipal systems of basic education, but rather their detachment from the cycle of regeneration of Rio de Janeiro.<\/p>\n<p>The urban mobility systems, on the other hand, are being designed and implemented considering only the demands of Mega-Events, ignoring that 61% of the employed residents of the metropolitan periphery \u2013 about 740,000 people \u2013 travel to work daily in the city of Rio de Janeiro, where most of the job opportunities are concentrated. Housing appreciation, resulting from the intensity of private and public investment combined with the expropriations carried out for the construction of urban infrastructure, is increasing demand for mobility in the metropolitan scale, due to the migration from the city centre to the periphery. Indeed, more than 50% of the population that migrates from the city of Rio de Janeiro to one of the 19 other cities in the metropolitan area continues to work in central Rio. This is a classic case of spatial mismatch between housing markets and labour, with important impacts on inequalities in access to employment opportunities and income.<\/p>\n<p>It is not possible to achieve the goal of increasing the quality of life without considering Rio de Janeiro as a mix of city and metropolis. However, the strategic plan of the city doesn&#8217;t even mention the existence of the Metropolitan periphery. This fact demonstrates the limits of the success of this praised urban regeneration experiment, via the model of entrepreneurial governance and focused on the goal of intercity competitiveness. This repeats itself in the case of Rio de Janeiro, the literature dedicated to the examining of the effects of similar urban policies has pointed out that the urban regeneration of the city takes place at the expense of increasing inequalities of real income of inhabitants measured by access to monetary income, urban welfare and opportunities. The forces that make up the urban coalition and the effects of its policies, based on the corporate design of the city, express a case similar to the historical events described by historian Barbara W. Tuchman as \u201cThe March of Folly&#8221;. We are not properly taking advantage of the historic opportunity created by the city&#8217;s preparation for the Mega-events of 2014 and 2016. The adopted development strategy, disregarding the mix of city and metropolis, tends to leave an even more unequal territory as legacy. This opportunity tends to be transitory due to coercive pressures of global economic flows, increasingly mobile, in increasing competitiveness among places, cities and regions. There are several examples of cities that achieved growth and regeneration cycles as a result of the adoption of these policies and, afterwards, ended up going through cycles of crisis and stagnation.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"<p><sup>1<\/sup> IDEB combines information on performance obtained by the students at the end of their basic education (the fifth and ninth years of fundamental education and the third year of middle level education) with an indicator of the promotion rate to the following school grades.<\/p>\n","pdf_uri":"","article_publishing_date":"October 2013","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"441","name":"Luiz Cesar","created":"2013-10-21 12:05:42","modified":"2013-10-21 12:05:42","slug":"de-queiroz-ribeiro-luiz-cesar","family_name":"de Queiroz Ribeiro","title":"","email_address":"","photo_legacy":"","profile_text":"","organization":"","role":"","additional_affiliations":"","qualifications":"","staff_pages_blurb":"","office_location":"","display_after":"","display_until":"","extended_blurb":"","special_2012ec_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb":"","special_2013rio_affiliation":"","special_2013rio_blurb_lang2":"","special_2013rio_affiliation_lang2":"","phone_number":null}],"attachments":false,"gallery":{"slug":false,"extra_classes":"","slides":[]}},{"request_language":"","current_page_uri":"\/media\/search-dev.json","lang2_slug":"pt-br","lang2_name":"Portuguese (Brasil)","parent_publication_id":1,"featured_image_uri":"","article_title":"Safe Spaces in S\u00e3o Paulo","permalink":"safe-spaces-in-sao-paulo","article_subtitle":"","article_abstract":"<p>A detailed study by Paula Miraglia traces the complex relationships between crime, spatial segregation and quality of life in the centre and the periphery.<\/p>\n","article_summary":"","article_text":"<p><div id=\"attachment_79\" style=\"width: 406px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-79\" title=\"15_SA08Ref_Miraglia1\" src=\"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/09\/15_SA08Ref_Miraglia1.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"396\" height=\"468\" \/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Crime in Jardim \u00c2ngela, once declared by the United Nations as the homicide capital of the world, is today substantially reduced thanks to community and state interventions.<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Crime in Jardim \u00c2ngela, once declared by the United Nations as the homicide capital of the world, is today substantially reduced thanks to community and state interventions.<\/p>\n<p>Violence and therefore safety \u2013 as themes and elements of social configuration \u2013 play a major role in the construction and characterisation of Brazil\u2019s major urban centres. Since the 1980s, marked increases in urban crime alongside the emergence of democratic openness and urbanisation have transformed Brazil\u2019s cities. The proliferation of robberies, thefts, kidnappings and violent deaths has promoted criminality and a consolidation of fear and insecurity as commonplace characteristics of urban life. Murder rates in the country\u2019s capitals have grown significantly, especially among adolescents between 15 and 24 years old. While the average rates for the entire population remained stable between 1980 and 2002, ranging from 21.3 to 21.7 for every 100,000 inhabitants, those among young people skyrocketed from 30 to 54.5. In S\u00e3o Paulo, violence today conjures two opposing trends: while in the 1980s and 1990s a systematic increase in murder rates scared the city (in 1999 the rate was 43.2), both the state and the Metropolitan Region benefited from a significant reduction over the last six years, so that by 2005 the murder rate had already dropped to 22.<\/p>\n<p>S\u00e3o Paulo, with a rate now lower than the national average and that of Recife, Vitoria or Rio de Janeiro, presents itself as a genuine exception. For although violence remains a constituent part of the city\u2019s configuration, especially with regards to its recent history, the city has nonetheless established new patterns of sociability that allow for a renewed understanding of the city and its public and private spaces. This understanding and subsequent use patterns influence the city\u2019s spatial and architectural configuration as well as the opposition between centre and periphery. At the same time, the reduction of murders entails a reflection on the strategies involved in the process of confronting a violent sociability and also signifies broader trends related to concepts of violence and safety.<\/p>\n<p>Despite the constant reduction in murder rates, neither academics nor policy makers have been able to form a consensus about its causes. The reduction has been attributed to an extensive and varied set of factors: state interventions such as the improvement of management policies (for example the creation of INFOCRIM, an electronic database that facilitates communication between the city\u2019s various police districts to produce an overall mapping of crime statistics) and increased investigative police activity; the work of non-governmental organisations and community engagement in the most violent areas; policies such as the \u2018dry law\u2019 in some municipalities; reduced availability of firearms; demographic changes in the state and other parts of the country over recent years; and even the rise of Evangelism in the suburbs.<\/p>\n<p>The justifications alternate depending on who constructs the explanatory narrative, with each proposed cause subject to ongoing research and controversy regarding its relevance and effectiveness. Even so, besides the multiple causes of violence, an important battle in the political and institutional arena is taking place over the factors creating the supposed increase in safety and the different ways of confronting it. Which is the best strategy: prevention or suppression? Must safety be a subject that is primarily the responsibility of the police, or does it deserve the attention of other areas of public policies such as urbanism, health or education? If we add safety and violence to the top metropolitan problems \u2013 contrary to transport, flooding and pollution, the city\u2019s other major challenges \u2013 solutions are typically not addressed through urban interventions. In the face of violence and insecurity, typically resources emanate from the criminal justice system, the police force, or other repression apparatuses. This equation shows a failure: originally, safety is a problem of the city, but not for the city. The metropolis assumes a secondary role in formulating policies for the prevention and confrontation of violence, as it is unable to actively participate in changes that promote safe spaces for living and social interaction.<\/p>\n<p>However, an analysis of S\u00e3o Paulo shows how a district, as a place of transformation as well as physical and social interaction, plays a key role in these processes. Mapping the types of safe spaces in different neighbourhoods can reveal the unequal distribution of violence in the city. The concentration of murders, along with other violent crimes against life, in the suburbs demonstrates how S\u00e3o Paulo practises an uneven risks economy. Territorial analysis also allows a deeper understanding of how the city deals with the issue of safety: which are the strategies of each district or region? What are the consequences of each option or arrangement? What is their potential for universal application? And finally, what is the impact on the city\u2019s sociability and the life of its inhabitants?<\/p>\n<p>Mapping the heterogeneity of social expressions in an apparently homogenous area in socio-demographical terms allows the differentiation of forms which define the \u2018periphery\u2019. Research developed by the Centre for Metropolitan Studies (CEM) of four areas in S\u00e3o Paulo \u2013 Jardim Paulista in the centre, Cidade Tiradentes in the East, Jardim \u00c2ngela in the South and Vila Nova Cachoerinha\/Brasil\u00e2ndia in the North \u2013 has revealed various conditions of poverty within the same area. To distinguish between them, the studies considered social group characteristics, combining variables associated with income, education, unemployment, access to urban infrastructure and race or ethnicity. From these isolated indicators, it was possible to make a detailed description of the distribution of such social groups and their living conditions.<\/p>\n<p>As the distribution of violence and safety influences patterns of sociability, and affects each district differently, the answers revealed phenomena that also take into account the particular characteristics of each area. Thus combining social and demographic characteristics such as income, skin colour and education with symbolic and material resources such as public services, community engagement levels, informal arrangements or the very history of the neighbourhood, each community creates its \u2018repertory of safety\u2019 to be assessed against certain violence scenarios. Crime distribution in S\u00e3o Paulo is a good starting point to examine this diversity. If, on the one hand, the association between poverty and crime is discarded, the coincidence of lower income, higher concentration of slums, greater presence of black and brown people, low education levels and the concentration of murders on the other hand cannot be ignored. Other than emphasising the unequal distribution of violence, such a scenario offers a macro-analysis which \u2013 alongside other elements \u2013 helps to trace a portrait of the periphery and ultimately forms a major contribution to understanding the relationship that is established between the periphery and its residents and the centre. Certainly the occupation and distribution of groups in the city also results from state interventions (or the lack of them), therefore these social indicators are essential to limit periphery areas. But the relational character of the centre\/periphery opposition, and its attendant spatial understanding, implies a certain perspective that must also recognise the diverse political and cultural context of what peripheral signifies.<\/p>\n<p>The victimisation of neighbourhoods alone is not enough. Firstly, because not all districts with high rates of vulnerability in S\u00e3o Paulo have high murder rates. Secondly, even in those districts where we find a combination of vulnerability and violence there is a wide range of strategies. We are much more interested in exploring the differences that such scenarios may produce and in identifying cycles in which violence and safety are at the same time producers and products of a particular type of social interaction. Selecting two opposing poles in the Metropolitan Region provides information that can help build a repertory of safety in the city. Doing so reflects on how these strategies combine the categories of \u2018space\u2019 and \u2018sociability\u2019 and how this interaction and diversity are building the city.<\/p>\n<p>Located just three kilometres from the centre of the city, the neighbourhood of Jardim Paulista (Jardins) correspondsto the city\u2019s urban development pattern and constitutes a wealthy neighbourhood in the city\u2019s South-East area. Jardins is considered very safe, with a mix of residential and commercial spaces that bring together a wide range of shops characterising the city\u2019s luxury retail market. The clientele combines local residents with visitors who enjoy the leisure activities and shopping offered by the district. Recent changes increased the area\u2019s safety, although they were intended to improve something that already existed, such as the widening of pavements or enhanced lighting. These interventions were not substantive; on the contrary, the objectives promoted consolidation and stability associated with a sense of peace and safety. An idea of completeness is added to this perception. From the perspective of the residents, the fact that shopping, leisure and social activities can all be carried out with relative proximity is experienced as something positive. \u2018I don\u2019t need to leave the neighbourhood\u2019, is often heard. Strategies to protect shops and residential buildings include mixing private security guards or signs indicating that the space is being watched with more hidden features such as surveillance cameras. Even large shop windows generate selective action, and together these interventions both appeal to, and inhibit, passers-by.<\/p>\n<p>One of the most recurring elements when talking about fear or the feeling of insecurity is \u2013 not incidentally \u2013 based on the presence of someone else, usually a non-resident or a worker from the region. But these \u2018others\u2019 are not random: street sales people, beggars and the homeless populate the category of those that are \u2018displaced\u2019 and are all blamed by local residents as potential threats to peace and safety in the neighbourhood. The CAPE (Centre for Permanent Assistance) of the Secretary of Social Assistance offers a service that is advertised on the residents\u2019 association website, which receives \u2018complaints\u2019 about homeless people that are near or in front of their homes, and they \u2019intervene\u2019. In this quick description, the various attempts to homogenise the area reduce diversity using strategies of avoidance of non-equals, and promote urban interventions that ensure a single standard of sociability.<\/p>\n<p>On the other side of the metropolis, more than 31 kilometres from the centre, the Cidade Tiradentes district and housing complex \u2013 the largest in Latin America \u2013 occupies a peripheral location in the city\u2019s far East. The area, previously a farm called Santa Etelvina, was acquired by Cohab, the metropolitan housing authority, at the end of the 1970s, to be incorporated into the urban network as low-value lots. Built from the 1980s onwards, the large scale of this housing complex eventually produced a uniformity to the landscape which became a defining feature of Cidade Tiradentes. For two decades the neighbourhood had a reputation as one of the worst places to live in S\u00e3o Paulo. The main problems highlighted by residents were the long distance from the centre, violence, limited public investment in basic urban infrastructure and almost no shops. Added to this was the fact that, until recently, the region lived under territorial dispute between criminal organisations, further evidence of its high murder rate. In recent years, however, a series of profound transformations such as the construction of the Tiradentes Bus Terminal have transformed the area. The terminal has significantly improved access to other regions of the city, thus reducing the distance and sense of isolation, while ensuring greater movement of residents to other sectors of the neighbourhood.<\/p>\n<p>Over time the structure of the housing complex has changed. The first- and second-generation buildings were subjected to interventions proposed by the residents. The construction of walls, sentry boxes (though permanently disabled) and the addition of security bars accompanied attempts to enhance the buildings aesthetically. These interventions went beyond the mere improvement of safety standards and defined a process of \u2018consolidation\u2019 of the property that incorporated new standards and references. As a result, more recent buildings were constructed with active sentry boxes and electronic gates already in place.<\/p>\n<p>At the same time the neighbourhood became dominated by a single criminal faction: the First Command of the Capital (PCC). Its exclusivity marked the end of territorial disputes in the area, causing a reduction of murders in the immediate vicinity. With the arrival of the police and expansion of the district police squad, crime today occupies an area called \u2018Fund\u00e3o\u2019 with a clear territorial demarcation of the activities showing that they have therefore lost a central position in the life of the neighbourhood. The arrival of shops and more diversified public and private services in the area have completed its transformation. Major chain-stores and supermarkets now serve the residents and are seen as important achievements by neighbourhood residents. In this sequence of progressive acquisitions, a bank is one of the last elements still missing.<\/p>\n<p>Thus, even if the area is not totally homogenous, with some pockets benefiting more than others from such changes, the image of a violent neighbourhood is changing into that of one with potential for economic and social development. This process was able to transform the residents\u2019 sense of belonging and has changed perceptions among residents about how to access their city.<\/p>\n<p>The presence of public power, exemplified by the increase of police action and by the bus terminal, as well as the multiplication of services offered were responsible for the diversification of the landscape and its social fabric, which nowadays is more pluralistic and varied. Therefore, it can be argued that Cidade Tiradentes has made use of a social diversification strategy. The heterogeneity of the neighbourhood has become a factor of resilience. The permanence of the PCC indicates that it is not impossible to live with violence or crime; the continued proliferation of slums emphasises that the region is still extremely socially and economically vulnerable. But these changes show that the district was able to lift itself beyond a position of victimisation.<\/p>\n<p>Despite the ethnographic wealth of both examples, we are not interested in caricatures to illustrate the differences between rich and poor neighbourhoods. Instead, the issues and problems that actually are in permanent dialogue with the wider structures of urban interaction that merit attention. Many of the elements mentioned in both cases have been repeated, with appropriate contextual adaptations, and offer themselves as genuine choices for the city and its residents. Together with other tools of segregation, they form a fragmented city in which the channels of communication between centre and periphery are constantly weakened. Using a so-called \u2018repertoire of safety\u2019 may become a permanent mechanism to promote the actualisation of inequalities.<\/p>\n<p>Taking the difference between homogeneity and heterogeneity in Cidade Tiradentes as an example, the void resulting from the lack of public and private services, together with an endlessly repeated anonymous architectural pattern, created residents\u2019 resignation about the region\u2019s vulnerability. Therefore the strengthening and enhancement of the complexity of the social fabric are associated with changes that, in this case, produce movement and circulation: elements that can provide physical, symbolic and social interaction between groups from within the district and from the rest of the city.<\/p>\n<p>In the case of Jardins, however, the transformation takes the form of permanence and repetition. The maintenance of certain urbanisation patterns ultimately perpetuates the homogeneity of the area, either in terms of space, or with regards to visitors\u2019 profile and characteristics. It has established itself as a well-maintained progressive area. Jardins reinforces a sense of community that is generated by an organic enclosure of the neighbourhood. There is nothing new about using separation strategies inspired by protection: the high walls of closed apartment blocks, the gates and the guards make it easy to identify this set of mechanisms. But when it comes to open spaces, involving streets and pavements, segregation tools go beyond physical aspects. From this perspective, imitating the fluidity and the ample capacity of the circulation of violence, safety appears to be a continuum, that, like violence, is supported by urbanisation resources that are merged with segregated sociability strategies. This projects the distinct separation of a determined area without building intentional explicit physical limits.<\/p>\n<p>The comparison between these two strategies to reduce crime and violence raises questions about the effectiveness of solutions. Although a reduction of murders is evident throughout the city, the question persists whether the peripheries will some day be less violent than the centre. The applied strategies are not able, or do not contemplate a reversal of the patterns of victimisation. Even if reduced, most violent deaths are concentrated in the periphery. The continuing victimisation and levels of violence, as well as the strategies of segregation, are obstacles in the subversion of the relation between centre and periphery which occur today.<\/p>\n<p>Cidade Tiradentes, the largest social housing development built by state and city authorities in the far eastern periphery of S\u00e3o Paulo, is defined by hundreds of identical residential buildings and poor social infrastructure.<br \/> Residents spend between two and three hours commuting each way for work.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_80\" style=\"width: 406px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-80\" title=\"15_SA08Ref_Miraglia2\" src=\"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/09\/15_SA08Ref_Miraglia2.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"396\" height=\"224\" \/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Cidade Tiradentes, the largest social housing development built by state and city authorities in the far eastern periphery of S\u00e3o Paulo, is defined by hundreds of identical residential buildings and poor social infrastructure.

If we assume that safety and its distribution shape the city, the opposition between \u2018strategies of protection\u2019 and \u2018safety development\u2019 seems to summarise the available options and translate the implications of each model. The first, more reactive strategy, mobilises an individual dimension of avoidance, while the second, propositional, emphasises the collective dimension of interaction between individuals and groups. The contrast suggests the limits of partial solutions to the problem. This is evident not only in the tension between the models of safe spaces in a safe city, but also through the way they announce a struggle for the city itself. In other words, the creation of safe spaces is not complemented by the perception of a safe city. Such models are exclusionary, and show that either the entire city is safe or no one is.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":"http:\/\/v0.urban-age.net\/0_downloads\/archive\/_SA\/16_NewsPaper_Essay_Miraglia.pdf","article_publishing_date":"December 2008","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"15","name":"Paula","created":"2011-09-01 12:03:19","modified":"2013-10-23 10:04:37","slug":"miraglia-paula","family_name":"Miraglia","title":"","email_address":"","photo_legacy":"","profile_text":"","organization":"","role":"","additional_affiliations":"","qualifications":"","staff_pages_blurb":"","office_location":"","display_after":"","display_until":"","extended_blurb":"","special_2012ec_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb":"Paula Miraglia is a consultant with extensive expertise in urban violence, youth, crime prevention and criminal justice.

Local and state authorities are taking actions to remedy the city\u2019s infamous traffic congestion and although official proposals are heading in the right direction, a more conceptual change would prioritise public transport, as well as pedestrians and cyclists.<\/p>\n<p>There are currently 313 km of metro and rail lines dedicated to passenger transportation in the Metropolitan Area. This is less than half the networks of either London, Berlin or New York, all in metropolitan regions smaller than S\u00e3o Paulo. Within Latin America, only Mexico City\u2019s rail network is on a par with S\u00e3o Paulo with a total of 553 km. To further complicate matters, some of S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s major commuter rail lines accommodate freight as well as passenger transport. Since the late 1990s, the State Secretary of Transport through Dersa (Empresa de Desenvolvimento Rodoviario) has started to implement a plan to segregate freight from passengers through construction of an outer road ring, the Rodoanel, and an outer rail ring, the Ferroanel, so that passengers will no longer have to share the same rail lines with freight trains.<\/p>\n<p>The Brazilian transport system is highly concentrated by the use of motorised traffic. Even so, in 2002 about 7.4 million journeys on public transport and 8 million car journeys took place in S\u00e3o Paulo, compared to 4.2 million public transit journeys and 4.9 million by car in the other municipalities combined. Then, the number of journeys by car represented 53 per cent of the daily total of motorised journeys in the Metropolitan Region, an increase from 48 per cent in 1997. Recently, though, this trend has begun to reverse: preliminary data from 2007 shows that car journeys are down to 45 per cent. It is thought that the introduction of the bilhete \u00fanico (single ticket), which allows users of the rail network to pay a standard fare, regardless of distance or number of connections, has reinvigorated the use of public transport. Use is very much concentrated on buses (76 per cent of journeys in 1997 and 72 per cent in 2002). And while the current use of bicycles is negligible, preliminary data from 2007 shows that 33 per cent of families in the Metropolitan Region own at least one bicycle. Increasing the supply of dedicated cycle lanes might increase the use of bicycles considerably.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-75\" title=\"13_SA08Ref_Biderman2\" src=\"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/08\/13_SA08Ref_Biderman2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"212\" height=\"263\" \/>S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s dedicated bus lanes, Corredores de \u00f4nibus, are similar to the TransMilenio in Bogot\u00e1, but are much less segregated from general traffic. Furthermore very few stations have passing lanes, and there is no high-level entry or fare pre-payment as in the TransMilenio. Operating at speeds only half that expected of a bus rapid transit (BRT) system, in 2005 the city\u2019s Corredores de \u00f4nibus occupied just 112 km of the 4,300 km of roads covered by the bus network. The first stage of a new bus line, the Tiradentes Expressway, was recently opened in the South-East of S\u00e3o Paulo, connecting the city centre with the largest social housing complex in Latin America, Cidade Tiradentes. When fully implemented, the Tiradentes Expressway will be able to transport 50,000 passengers per day. It is the only system in S\u00e3o Paulo comparable to a BRT as it currently runs at speeds over 30 km per hour along permanent, demarcated lanes. The current investments will add around 160 km of corridors.<\/p>\n<p>The general overall public transport plan for the S\u00e3o Paulo Metropolitan Region has been consolidated into an Urban Transport Integrated Plan (PITU) to include projections up to 2025. The PITU 2025 implies very few extensions to the commuter rail network, but a considerable improvement using profits generating from the separation of freight transport. The PITU proposal calls for the partial duplication of lines with new expressways, a single extension outwards as well as the extension of several lines inwards to make them all converge in one area. It also envisages two new lines, one of which will be an express train to the airport. In terms of bus corridors, besides adding more than 300 km to the network, PITU proposes 110 km of \u2018urban corridors\u2019 including passing points to increase their speed to the equivalent of a BRT system. The proposal projects a total of 580 km of new corridors by 2025. To generate these significant change, the system should be highly integrated, a priority of PITU 2025, which calls for 15 key terminals connecting the different modes of transport. Future terminals would start in the metro system and connect directly to buses or rail services at street level.<\/p>\n<p>Since the 1950s, transport policies in the S\u00e3o Paulo Metropolitan Region, as in most other Brazilian metropolitan areas, have neglected public transport, pedestrians and cyclists. The result is a chaotic and inefficient system with long commuting times, especially for the poor. The obvious way forward is to improve the supply of public transport. However, just improving the supply is not enough. A fundamental shift towards more equitable and sustainable transport modes is needed. Cars, buses, pedestrian, cyclists, motorcyclists and street sellers all compete for limited space on city streets, avenues and sidewalks. The government has the power to regulate the use of these spaces and to decide how they are distributed through a range of instruments. Increasing the space allocated to public transport, bicycles and pedestrians is an important first step to redistribute resources as these will specifically improve the lives of the poor. Since the poor have less access to private space for non-motorised uses, they use more public space for those purposes. This modal shift would also benefit the environment by reducing travel distances considerably.<\/p>\n<p>There is no doubt that the PITU proposals represent an advance in standards for public transport in the greater metropolitan area of S\u00e3o Paulo. Apart from increasing the length of its rail-based network, they also envisage integration of a bus rapid transit system in the region. Even so, the proposals may still be seen as rather timid given the magnitude of the city\u2019s transport challenges. To this end, the study developed by our research group has identified a number of strategies and initiatives that could enhance the impact and efficiency of the plan. Detailed analysis and proposals will be published in a separate report, but the main recommendations include expanding the proposed network of BRT lines by 190 km, upgrading all public transport corridors to BRT standard and adding 60 stations to the system. In addition to spatial strategies such as the future of the Minhoc\u00e3o, the study proposes new funding schemes that rely less on general state taxes and more on tax revenues from petrol, which have remained stagnant despite the massive increase in car ownership in recent years. The overall objective of this new cocktail of proposals is not simply to increase the supply of BRT lines but to bring about a paradigm shift in transport policy in S\u00e3o Paulo to prioritise the balance between public transport and the private car.<\/p>\n<p>One of the key focus areas of the study is the Elevado Costa e Silva, a major elevated motorway known as the Minhoc\u00e3o (big worm) built in 1971 by the national dictatorship government. Apart from its significant political associations, the overpass cuts East-West through downtown S\u00e3o Paulo and is considered to be partially responsible for the deterioration of the city\u2019s historic core. Despite this, the Minhoc\u00e3o is the main vehicular link between the centre and the city\u2019s western region. The S\u00e9 municipality that surrounds it is a socially diversified area characterised by a highly mixed land-use pattern, located close to S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s main public transport hub with access to metro, bus, and rail.<\/p>\n<p>The Minhoc\u00e3o covers an area of 3.4 km, about 5.5 metres above ground and its width varies between 15.5 and 23 meters, with some adjacent buildings within a very close distance of 5 metres. No bus lines run on the Minhoc\u00e3o while 80,000 vehicles pass on it each day. Its construction accelerated land and building depreciation in the downtown area, especially along the urban blocks which border it. In 1976, degradation was so severe that the city decided to close the Minhoc\u00e3o at night because of high accident rates and noise pollution. Today the structure is closed to vehicles on Sundays when it is used by city dwellers as a linear urban park. In 2003 a public transport corridor system was introduced at the lower level to integrate the network to the metro through the Marechal Deodoro and Santa Cecilia stations even though no physical connections were implemented.<\/p>\n<p>The study has identified the Minhoc\u00e3o as a major strategic component of the city\u2019s public realm. It proposes that the Minhoc\u00e3o be converted and that the resulting open space be turned into a permanent urban park for pedestrians and cyclists. Currently there are four lanes for cars on the top level and two lanes for buses and four lanes for cars at the lower level. The system could be easily modified in such a way that the entire upper level and two lower level lanes are given over to pedestrian and cycle routes. Overall four lanes that are currently used by cars could be used by public transport, cyclists and pedestrians. This strategy would transform an urban problem into an urban asset, increasing land values and potentially leading to a significant upgrading of the wider area, even though the economic impact would need to be carefully regulated.<\/p>\n<p>This proposal for the Minhoc\u00e3o must be seen as an exemplar of what could be achieved across the city if a new approach to public transport and the public realm were introduced in S\u00e3o Paulo, bringing with it considerable social, economic and financial benefits to the surrounding areas. On balance, the study proposes a new way of thinking about transport policies which prioritise modes of transport that have never been prioritised before. Its implementation does not require a substantive increase in expenditure but a diverse investment approach that shifts the balance away from individual to collective modes of travel.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":"http:\/\/v0.urban-age.net\/0_downloads\/archive\/_SA\/13_NewsPaper_Essay_Biderman.pdf","article_publishing_date":"December 2008","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"12","name":"Ciro","created":"2011-08-30 14:27:21","modified":"2011-08-30 15:27:38","slug":"ciro","family_name":"Biderman","title":null,"email_address":null,"photo_legacy":null,"profile_text":"","organization":"","role":"","additional_affiliations":null,"qualifications":null,"staff_pages_blurb":null,"office_location":null,"display_after":null,"display_until":null,"extended_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb_lang2":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation_lang2":null,"phone_number":null}],"attachments":false,"gallery":{"slug":false,"extra_classes":"","slides":[]}},{"request_language":"","current_page_uri":"\/media\/search-dev.json","lang2_slug":"pt-br","lang2_name":"Portuguese (Brasil)","parent_publication_id":41,"featured_image_uri":"","article_title":"Self, Community and Urban Frontiers in Rio de Janeiro","permalink":"self-community-and-urban-frontiers-in-rio-de-janeiro","article_subtitle":"","article_abstract":"","article_summary":"<p>Sandra Jovchelovitch highlights the issues that cause some orders between communities to remain more closed than others.<\/p>\n","article_text":"<p>Rio de Janeiro is a city of multiple and contradictory layers, at once exposed and hidden by its beauty and complex topography. The distances and overlaps between its neighbourhoods and people are vast and operate at many levels, all immediately noticeable to the senses of those who are in the city. Walking in Rio, close to the Atlantic Ocean, or beyond, through its forests, mountains, people and buildings, it is difficult to focus the eye on one single aspect, because the key characteristic of the city is juxtaposition and mixture, a vibrant carnival of geography and humanity, a space that is both urban and psycho-social, made of many lives, emotions, representations and behavioural patterns.<\/p>\n<p>Nowhere is this more evident than in the contrast between the <em>favelas<\/em> and affluent paved areas of the city, described in the everyday language of <em>Cariocas<\/em>, as the dichotomy <em>morro\/asfalto<\/em> (hill\/asphalt), a signifier everyone understands and uses to navigate the complexity of divisions and lines of segregation that characterise Rio. The separation <em>morro\/asfalto<\/em> is deeply connected to the process of urbanisation in Rio de Janeiro, which kept apart and yet grew dependent on the <em>favela<\/em> communities it marginalised.<\/p>\n<p>Officially called urban subnormal agglomerates, Rio\u2019s <em>favelas<\/em> are ecosystems of great complexity, in which a rich and diverse sociality coexists with chronic lack of state services, and heavy social control imposed by drug bosses and police violence. Since the 1980s drug cartels have gradually gained control over <em>favela<\/em> territories, initiating an undeclared and subterranean war with the police. Caught in the middle of this confrontation, <em>favela<\/em> dwellers became a target for the police and over-exposed to the routes of socialisation established by the institutional and business-like character of narco-traffic.<\/p>\n<p>As the population of <em>favelas<\/em> grew, the increase in violence and homicides, combined with the chronic lack of services and socio-economic deprivation configured an environment of intense social exclusion. Despite being integral to the economy and socio-cultural life of the city, <em>favela<\/em> communities were pushed underground, their actual sociability and multiple life forms hidden away by geographical, social, economic, symbolic and behavioural barriers.<\/p>\n<p>This preponderance of marked urban frontiers is a central aspect of Rio de Janeiro and a major component of life in the <em>favelas<\/em>. <em>Favela<\/em> dwellers love their communities as well as the city, but they are acutely aware of borders and separation. Crime, violence and marginalisation are equated from the outside with the identity of <em>favela<\/em> residents, who regularly experience discrimination as they cross borders into the wider city. Negative representations and the stigma generated in the asphalt hurt both socially and psychologically by barring access to work and earnings, and by affecting identity and self-esteem. The words <em>inside<\/em> and <em>outside<\/em> are strong signifiers, deployed to express both differences between the urban worlds and the sharp borders that separate them. Border controls in the city are subjectively internalised: people understand that there is danger when crossing into different <em>favelas<\/em> and feel the pain of prejudice and discrimination when crossing into other areas of the city.<\/p>\n<p>These issues can be illustrated by the psychosocial cartographies of four communities of Rio: Cantagalo, Cidade de Deus, Madureira and Vig\u00e1rio Geral, each located in a different area of the city. Cantagalo and Vig\u00e1rio Geral fit the accepted definition of <em>favelas<\/em>, whereas Cidade de Deus was built as a planned area for relocating <em>favela<\/em>-dwellers displaced from the city centre during the 1960s. Madureira is a formal neighbourhood surrounded by <em>favelas<\/em>. In their similarities and differences, each one of these four communities illuminates how geographical borders intersect with social and psychological frameworks to connect territory, community identity and a sense of self in the city.<\/p>\n<p>As with any map, psychosocial cartographies are established by borders. These can be more or less porous, depending on a combination of psychological and geographical elements, which establish the relations between the <em>favelas<\/em> and the city. These elements include the range and quality of social institutions present in a community, its location in relation to the wider city, the presence or absence of urban connectors, the experience of leisure of its inhabitants and the social representations held by the city as a whole about the area.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Cantagalo<\/strong> is located between Ipanema and Copabacana, at the heart of South Rio and its beautiful natural landscape. It benefits from the state services and commercial facilities of these formal neighbourhoods, despite the absence of these from the <em>favela<\/em> itself. The community is connected to Ipanema by a lift and a paved road, which makes it easy to come and go, even more so since the expulsion of the drug trade and the introduction of the Pacification Police Unit (UPP). Social representations of the area are mixed, including positive and negative dimensions. There is flow both ways in terms of leisure, services and intergroup contact, making Cantagalo\u2019s borders highly porous.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Madureira<\/strong> is in the centre of North Rio and open to the city, although distance gives some density to its borders. There are multiple institutions in Madureira and the neighbourhood enjoys its own facilities and vibrant popular culture. It is placed at the crossroads between the different cultures of Rio and offers multiple references for the sociability of its residents. Madureira is associated with poverty, but also with conviviality and important cultural traditions of the city. Its large market is a strong urban reference, and samba schools such as Portela are exemplary of its rich influence in the life of Rio. Its borders show medium to high porosity; they are very wide and not controlled by the drug trade.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Cidade de Deus<\/strong> is located remotely in the western part of Rio, close to forests and to the Barra neighbourhood, its beach and overall facilities. References for sociability are focused on the drug trade and the evangelical churches, although the UPPs are introducing a new, if uneasy, relationship with the state. There is freedom to come and go but leisure is concentrated inside the community, mainly for fear of discrimination. Dominant social representations of Cidade de Deus continue to link the community to the drug trade, poverty and violence. Its borders show low porosity: they are no longer controlled by narco-traffic, but internalised segregation keeps the horizons of the community primarily inside its own territory.<\/p>\n<p>In <strong>Vig\u00e1rio Geral<\/strong>, scarcity of social institutions and distance from the city reduce the references for the sociability of its residents, which is polarised between AfroReggae, an important NGO originated in the community, and the drug trade. The drug trade is the central organiser of community life, and, along with the evangelical churches, AfroReggae, and the sporadic presence of the police, comprise the social institutions of the <em>favela<\/em>. Crossfire and stray bullets are part of everyday life; the area is closed and tightly controlled, and circulation is difficult. Vig\u00e1rio Geral is strongly associated with wars between factions of the drug trade and the violence of the police. The territory of the community circumscribes the leisure and the horizons available for its residents.<\/p>\n<p>Levels of porosity in community borders shape the context that is offered to pathways of socialisation inside <em>favelas<\/em> as well as the nature of the relationship between the communities and the wider city. Levels of porosity of borders correlate with the breadth of social networks and potential crossings that are available in the everyday life of <em>favela<\/em> dwellers. The broader the networks and looser the borders, the more the experience of the self is broadened. The denser the borders, the lesser the chances of expanding networks and crossing into the wider city, while the need and importance attributed to the few institutions, good or bad, that operate in the community rise.<\/p>\n<p>Porosity of borders between peripheral communities and the wider public sphere of the city is a major factor defining the routes of socialisation and the individual and collective experience of the city. Actions on the flexibility of urban frontiers are central for the enlargement of the self, the regeneration of territories of exclusion and for giving back to <em>favela<\/em> dwellers the right to the city. Keeping borders open contributes to the transformation of identities and the development of citizenship. It connects a divided society and avoids the formation of ghettos that isolate and prevent the vibrancy embedded in the social and cultural encounters of the contemporary city. The Viaduto in Madureira and the Centro Cultural Waly Salom\u00e3o in Vig\u00e1rio Geral are exemplary of these processes: they operate as places of encounter, learning, development, psychosocial containment and conviviality, bringing the city to the <em>favela<\/em> and the <em>favela<\/em> to the city. In regenerating the public sphere and the built environment of popular communities, they also regenerate Rio de Janeiro, establish a bridge between hitherto separated social worlds, and take a further step towards the communicative city.<\/p>\n<p>The experience of Rio corroborates the need to decentralise urban planning and consolidate the vistas offered by the mixed city of the twenty-first century. Cleaning the city of its poor by removing <em>favelas<\/em> and unwanted populations from sight is not a sustainable urban solution, and not only because it violates the fundamental right to the city. The study of <em>favela<\/em> life shows that despite social exclusion there is resilience, a powerful culture and a proud collective intelligence living on the edges of the city. To recognise the <em>favela<\/em> and the potentials of its people, culture and economy requires urban policy committed to social integration, without which Rio de Janeiro\u2019s development will always be partial.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":"","article_publishing_date":"October 2013","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"417","name":"Sandra","created":"2013-10-17 10:37:07","modified":"2013-10-18 23:37:55","slug":"jovchelovitch-sandra","family_name":"Jovchelovitch","title":"","email_address":"","photo_legacy":"","profile_text":"Sandra Jovchelovitch is Professor of Social Psychology at the London School of Economics and Political Science and co-author of <em>Underground Sociabilities<\/em>, a study of Rio\u2019s favelas.","organization":"","role":"","additional_affiliations":"","qualifications":"","staff_pages_blurb":"","office_location":"","display_after":"","display_until":"","extended_blurb":"","special_2012ec_blurb":"","special_2012ec_affiliation":"","special_2013rio_blurb":"Sandra Jovchelovitch is Professor of Social Psychology at the LSE.

Since 1990, housing space per capita has more than doubled to reach almost 15 square meters in 2003. Some improvements are also noticeable in the quality of the urban environment, with the area of urban parks and woods multiplying almost sevenfold, covering over 35% of the urbanised area of Shanghai. Despite these improvements in living conditions however, nearly half of households experience overcrowding, and a further 16% suffer from severe overcrowding.<\/p>\n<p>As metropolitan growth continues, high-rise buildings fill the dense city centre and new towns are constructed along peripheral ring roads. Yet, in a pattern where concentration predominates over dispersal, close to half of Shanghai&#8217;s population lives in an area smaller than 5% of its total land surface. Urban densities average slightly over 40,000 residents per square kilometre in the city&#8217;s four core districts and reach a peak of 760 persons per hectare in Huangpu&#8217;s central neighbourhood of Old West Gate, just south of the People&#8217;s Square. It is interesting to note, however, that the structural densification of the city centre is occurring at the same time that population densities have decreased in this area, following development imperatives towards increasing the quantity of living space per resident.<\/p>\n<p>Household size has been decreasing over time and small households now comprise a considerable proportion of the population. The massive changes to Shanghai&#8217;s housing conditions have not been without social friction. Speculation in the housing market in both development and resale, mostly at the luxury end of market (symptomatic of increasing inequality in terms of housing consumption) has prompted government actions to increase interest rates and discourage non-occupant ownership. Conflicts over development rights have flared at the city&#8217;s periphery, where farmers seek to convert agricultural land into profitable housing for both migrant workers and the wealthy. In central neighbourhoods, policies of slum clearance and the accompanying displacement of residents to more suburban areas have been met by some community protest.<\/p>\n<p>At the same time, new social structures, such as residents&#8217; management committees in high rise towers, are evolving to address the particular conditions of new housing typologies.

Important challenges have resulted from the city&#8217;s many successes in terms of economic development, attracting foreign investment, international trade, transformation of its built environment and upgrading of its urban infrastructure. These challenges require more complex planning processes and policy interventions than the formulas deployed so far. Shanghai now needs to assume a more defined economic identity and adopt a set of strategic priorities to guide its metropolitan development path. As the density of economic interactions has increased at multiple scales, making decisions about Shanghai&#8217;s economic future also implies shaping its role in the Yangtze River region, the People&#8217;s Republic of China, the Asia Pacific and the wider world economy.<\/p>\n<p>Strengthening its centrality at one level may pose negative consequences to the city&#8217;s other roles &#8211; becoming a consolidated global city that is attractive to international investors and leading economic sectors may require different types of public investments and interventions than growing as China&#8217;s industrial powerhouse and job generator for a rapidly urbanising population. A number of different questions arise from this dilemma. To what degree should policy makers attempt to strengthen the city&#8217;s advanced services sector? How much effort should be put in to upgrading, modernising and expanding its manufacturing base? Are post-industrial New York and London the models to learn from, or will Shanghai be better off following broader base high-tech development strategies such as those of Tokyo and the city-regions of California. In broader terms, can Shanghai learn from established urban models of economic growth and what lessons can it teach the urban world in terms of development expediency and urban restructuring at a breathtaking pace? What synergies can be fostered between the leading economic sectors of car production, semiconductors, petrochemicals, trade, finance and real estate and construction?

Borne out by the impressive statistics, it is the actual experience of movement in the public spaces of the city that makes one feel the enormity of the transformation. Walking among thousands of commuters at Shanghai&#8217;s largest underground interchange under People&#8217;s Square or attempting to cross a six-lane highway across the Bund to snatch a view of the esplanade, emphasises the sense of stress of a burgeoning city. In the ten years to 2000, the length of roads increased by 40 per cent, and the number of cars quadrupled to just over one million. Official predictions state that by 2020 Shanghai will have 2.5 million private cars, and that daily motor vehicle trips will increase to seven million compared to just over three million in 2000. Public transport provision will increasingly rely on Shanghai&#8217;s rail system, which the city is planning to expand to 540 km in 2020. The metro system&#8217;s current daily capacity of 1.4 million is predicted to reach 10 million in 2020.<\/p>\n<p>Increasing levels of car ownership and the expanding car industry in Shanghai- regarded by China&#8217;s economic planners as a key growth sector-will increasingly challenge the very essence of the city. Prosperity associated with employment in car manufacturing and its associated industries is a key driver of Shanghai&#8217;s economic welfare. So are the improvements to the standard of living promised by quiet, comfortable homes away from the overcrowded and polluted central city. In comparison to other cities like London and Paris, Shanghai has an extremely low percentage of road space &#8211; literally, the amount of tarmac &#8211; making it structurally incompatible for a city with a projected exponential growth in car traffic. Further-more, rising levels of car use would exacerbate increasing energy consumption, worsen pollution and add to traffic congestion. Hence, the heated debate in policy circles of whether precious farmland surrounding the city should be sacrificed to new roads and urban sprawl.<\/p>\n<p>There is a risk that Shanghai&#8217;s communities, already challenged by a widening income gap, could be faced with a lasting physical imprint of separation that will inhibit social cohesion. The city is also facing a familiar yet difficult choice in funding priorities, needing to decide between investing in more and more road and parking projects, or increasing spending on public transport. The newly rich and empowered car lobby is proactive in making its voice heard, arguing against car restrictions and taxes, that make it more difficult to manage urban mobility and the use of cars.<\/p>\n<p>For the central area, where the growing number of vehicles is particularly problematic, two strategies are being followed. The first is to increase road density levels, mainly by constructing elevated highways. The second is to focus on improving the capacity of the existing network, mainly by separating different transport modes. Cycling, although banned on most main roads, is still vital. Today some nine million bicycles are owned by the Shanghainese, and are used for 30% of all trips. However, cycling is now viewed as a competitor to public transport, slowing down traffic and causing accidents. The city aims to reduce its share by 25% within the next five years. Walking is regarded as an integral part of Shanghai&#8217;s transport system not only for short journeys but also as a feeder for public and private transport, and there are plans to expand the network of pedestrian streets including the pedestrianisation of the Bund alongside the Huangpu River by building a tunnel to accommodate the existing six-lane highway.<\/p>\n<p>The future of Shanghai&#8217;s physical structure will not only be strongly influenced by its transport system, but also by the decisions made regarding density levels and mixed-use zoning. Reducing residential density levels within the inner city, and building beyond the edge of the city, is regarded as the key to increasing the amount of personal living space. A rigid zoning approach, which separates uses and dedicates large proportions of land &#8211; particularly for new developments &#8211; to discrete residential, office, industrial or service uses, will have a huge impact on mobility requirements. Over the last 10 years, the daily distance travelled by Shanghai residents has increased by 50%. The consequences of this land-use policy are already apparent: the original plan to build nine new satellite cities surrounding Shanghai &#8211; all of which would have to rely on rapid transit access &#8211; have been dramatically curtailed due to cost implications, and only three new towns are currently under construction.<\/p>\n<p>Clearly, Shanghai&#8217;s transport demands are not directly comparable to European or North American cities. Yet, it is intriguing to note that the private car, which most competes with public transport in cities like London, New York or Berlin, is seen in Shanghai as complementary to public transport, (particularly buses), and that &#8220;third means&#8221;- bicycles and motorbikes &#8211; are regarded as problematic and targeted for elimination. Quite a paradigm reversal from the current fashion for sustainable development in western cities.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":null,"article_publishing_date":"July 2005","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"102","name":"Shiling","created":"2011-11-02 14:46:23","modified":"2011-11-02 14:47:55","slug":null,"family_name":"Zheng","title":null,"email_address":null,"photo_legacy":null,"profile_text":null,"organization":null,"role":null,"additional_affiliations":null,"qualifications":null,"staff_pages_blurb":null,"office_location":null,"display_after":null,"display_until":null,"extended_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb_lang2":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation_lang2":null,"phone_number":null}],"attachments":false,"gallery":{"slug":false,"extra_classes":"","slides":[]}},{"request_language":"","current_page_uri":"\/media\/search-dev.json","lang2_slug":false,"lang2_name":false,"parent_publication_id":4,"featured_image_uri":"","article_title":"Shanghai: Overview","permalink":"shanghai-overview","article_subtitle":"The Speed and the Friction","article_abstract":"","article_summary":"","article_text":"<p>Fifty years ago Shanghai was an island of floodlit art deco cinemas, modern skyscrapers and electric trams, marooned in the midst of a China that had hardly changed in a thousand years. As the city petered out on the road to Nanjing, the neon signs and the street lights disappeared into the darkness of a medieval night. To drive across the city in those days, you needed three different driving licenses to negotiate your way from the Chung Hwa Road to what was then called the Boulevard des Deux Republiques, to Edward VII Avenue and Broadway. You could have worshipped in your choice of onion domed Russian Orthodox churches, the product of the army of White Russian refugees who sailed out of Vladivostock with the Bolsheviks at their heels. It&#8217;s a history that suggests a city shaped by a mix of pragmatism, opportunism and anarchy. Shanghai was China&#8217;s window on the world, its most industrially advanced and commercially sophisticated city. And it still is, even as Beijing is working hard to re-establish pre-eminence with a building programme in the capital that is just as frenetic as Shanghai&#8217;s. Shanghai&#8217;s decision to hold an Expo in 2010 is its own response to the 2008 Olympics in Beijing.<\/p>\n<p>There is a tendency among western observers to look at China&#8217;s two great cities, Shanghai and Beijing, as vast urban agglomerations that have broken the bounds of size and scale and so isolate themselves from conventional urban precedents. But in terms of population size, Shanghai, with around 20 million people is a city of the same order of magnitude as New York, and London, both metropolises with a population of around 18 million. The most striking differences between Shanghai, London and New York are political organisation and urban culture. Shanghai is effectively a city state, with the powers of the central government at its disposal to annex satellite towns and villages and to open up territory into its direct control. We know Shanghai is big because there is no obfuscation about the difference between the city in the political sense, and in wider definitions of it as an entity. But, as much as we are ready to analyse London or New York as urban regions, the perception is still shaped by political boundaries.<\/p>\n<p>Shanghai, where one in five of its population is made up of temporary in-migrants from predominantly rural China, is the key city setting the pattern for the explosive urban growth in Asia. It is as much a phenomenon of our times as the equally rapid and &#8211; to its contemporaries &#8211; equally disturbing transformation of Western industrial cities of the early 19th century. It is a phenomenon which is producing a sense of strangeness and dislocation, this time bound up with the overwhelming impact of speed. When the British happened on the Chinese walled settlement of Shanghai towards the end of the Opium War and fought for their right to sell the opium that they cultivated in India to the citizens of the Chinese empire, there was nothing on what is now the Pudong side of the Huang Po River. British traders, attracted by the river traffic on the Yangtze river and its many tributaries linking inland China and the trade routes from Europe, America and later Japan, persuaded their government to insist on their unhindered access to Shanghai&#8217;s port.<\/p>\n<p>Fossilised through the Mao years, the Bund still looks like a hallucinogenic transplant of a European city to Asia. But Shanghai was never a traditional colony. The city was run, by a series of different, but parallel administrations. It was an arrangement that allowed a hybrid culture to flourish in the cracks between regimes. In large parts of the city, it was never entirely clear exactly who was responsible for enforcing any kind of legal system.<\/p>\n<p>The long freeze on Shanghai&#8217;s development only lifted at the end of the 1980s,with the introduction of the market economy to China. In terms of physical development and planning, this triggered a great deal of research into appropriate models for Shanghai. Of course Hong Kong, with its carefully managed state land bank and the government&#8217;s use of auctions to fundraise and control development, was studied with care. But so was the experience of Barcelona as it emerged from its transformation for the Olympics of 1992. Before the wave of new building really took hold, Shanghai staged an architectural competition for a redevelopment strategy to deal with the whole Pudong area. It showed both the strengths and weaknesses of Shanghai&#8217;s position. Many of the world&#8217;s leading architects &#8211; Toyo Ito, Massimiliano Fuksas and Richard Rogers among them &#8211; were invited to take part. They all put forward more or less radical attempts at masterplanning, all of them mutually exclusive in their approach to land-use and form. The city claims to have adopted the best features of all the competitors, and the development of a new business district in Pudong has proceeded at breakneck speed, although along lines that bear little resemblance to anything that emerged in the competition.<\/p>\n<p>Shanghai has moved beyond the first rush of crude tower building, and the mood has changed. In central Shanghai, the American architects led by John Portman who were responsible for many of the early high rises, have given way to a wider selection of designers, who are beginning to demonstrate a more considered range of approaches. As demonstrated by the property investment in the Bund, and in some of the surviving fragments of 19th century Shanghai, the city is also beginning to develop a more nuanced attitude to its own past. Under the Pearl television tower you find the Mayor&#8217;s call to his citizens to &#8220;Rejoice in the present, while recalling the past&#8221; carved in both Chinese and English into a low granite wall. Shanghai is determined that every visitor knows all about what is going on now, and expresses this in language that seems to recall the days of the Red Guards. &#8220;Persist in the development of Pudong without wavering until it is done&#8221; reads one giant billboard. The city is busy planting trees and even the flyovers are fringed with planting boxes dangling green over the side of the road. It has installed its famous $700 million Maglev train system to make the 40 km trip to Pudong airport at an awesome 400 km per hour. And it is metamorphosing with such speed that it dynamited the central railway station built as recently as 1988. The city had already outgrown it.<\/p>\n<p>At the regional level, Shanghai is developing a policy for its position at the centre of the Yangtze delta. On a national level, it is competing with Hong Kong and Tokyo. It is moving beyond manufacturing to advanced service industries, as much a part of the rhetorical agenda for every ambitious city as culture-led renewal. The question facing Shanghai is if its best model is New York, London or Tokyo, or perhaps California, as it attempts to create a balance between its suburban industrial estates, and its high rise city centre. It is still working to reduce cycling by another 25 per cent in the next five years, just as it is working to reduce population densities in the inner city where there are still particularly crowded areas such as the Old West Gate, with people living at 760 to the hectare.<\/p>\n<p>Getting to grips with a city that has been undergoing double digit economic growth for more than a decade demands a set of conceptual tools rather different to the conventional repertoire employed by those who spend their time thinking about urban issues. The inescapable fact is speed. Shanghai is a city whose development over the last ten years has by any standards been extraordinarily rapid.<\/p>\n<p>The story of Shanghai&#8217;s speed and friction can be told in summary. Since 1990, living space per person has doubled to reach 15 square metres per resident. In the same period, the city has built 40% more roads. There are approaching two million cars. The metro system has reached a daily capacity of 1.4 million people, and is intended to reach five times that figure. The city has developed an entirely new business district in Pudong in less than two decades and it has embarked on the construction of a ring of satellite towns &#8211; designed in German, Italian, Scandinavian and Chinese urban styles. In the rush to build office towers to catch a perceived market, speed has been the determinant of form. Rather than give architects and engineers the time to produce considered technical solutions to optimise net to gross ratios, developers have demanded instant starts. Without time to make sophisticated calculations, engineers have over-specified structural cores. Buildings less than ten years old have aged with remarkable rapidity. Some have become redundant even before they are finished.<\/p>\n<p>In Shanghai, friction comes with speed. It&#8217;s the kind of friction that comes as development accelerates, and decelerates, the friction that fills the gap between the imperatives of what is still operating within the framework of a Marxist control and command economy, the actual results, and often unintended consequences. This provides an echo of the gaps between the administrations that ran the old Shanghai. You can see the will to centralise in the language of Shanghai&#8217;s plans. Not just in the huge signboard that exhorts its citizens to &#8220;Persist without wavering until it is done&#8221;, but even more in what the city calls &#8220;the six pillars&#8221;, not a Maoist call to arms, but a policy to build a strong economy based on cars, semiconductors, petrochemicals, trade, finance, real estate and construction.<\/p>\n<p>After New York, Shanghai is the second in the Urban Age investigations on cities. It provides a chance to learn from a city in the midst of a spasm of change so violent that it questions the extent of human resilience, to explore the meaning of speed and friction. It is a city which is moving so fast that it&#8217;s possible to see the impact of theory on practice like nowhere else in the world.<\/p>\n<p><em><br \/><\/em><\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":null,"article_publishing_date":"July 2005","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"1","name":"Deyan","created":"2011-08-23 13:50:55","modified":"2013-10-23 12:14:25","slug":"sudjic-deyan","family_name":"Sudjic","title":"","email_address":"","photo_legacy":"\/0_images\/02-DSudjic.jpg","profile_text":"<p>Deyan Sudjic is the Director of the Design Museum in London.

The towers, globally understood symbols of the city&#8217;s ambitions, coexist uneasily with a certain nostalgia for the built forms of the city&#8217;s colonial past. Tabula rasa developments on a huge scale transform entire sections of the city into new business districts at the same time that they make a point in preserving or recreating pockets of historic spaces. At the street level, the Shanghainese understand that their city is changing rapidly and many express unease about the disorientating pace of restructuring and the surreal spatial juxtapositions that it produces. In contrast to the apparent cohesion of the Mao years, the recent social transformation of Shanghai has resulted in a more diverse urban society where inequalities are as deep and the possibility for conflict as present as they were during the period of the international settlement. Expatriates from the Asia Pacific region and the West, highly educated overseas Chinese and a surfacing immigrant population engaged in some niches of the city&#8217;s service economy, all contribute to an increasingly complex and disjointed social landscape. No other group challenges the social order of Shanghai as much as Chinese internal migrants from rural areas, a &#8220;floating population&#8221; approaching 5 million with limited rights and vulnerable livelihoods. Poverty, low educational levels and the stigma of crime hinder the possibilities of incorporating this population into the social fabric of Shanghai. Developing a harmonious society in the city has become an official local public policy goal, one perhaps made more urgent by recent disturbances amongst disaffected migrant populations, and on the other hand, the central Chinese government&#8217;s policy directing the city to continue absorbing rural migrants and turning them into urban citizens. Sharing responsibility for security in public spaces with the support of both institutions and local communities is nothing new for urban Chinese, schooled in a culture that emphasises a collective sense of responsibility and with the experience of decades of a tightly controlled social order. Nevertheless, these objectives may necessitate the broader cultivation of conditions and perceptions of &#8220;security&#8221; capable of engaging a wide range of the city&#8217;s residents and a more profound understanding both of the nature of public spaces in a city in the midst of tidal change and of how these public spaces can contribute to a shared sense of community within the city.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":null,"article_publishing_date":"July 2005","article_tags":false,"article_authors":false,"attachments":false,"gallery":{"slug":false,"extra_classes":"","slides":[]}},{"request_language":"","current_page_uri":"\/media\/search-dev.json","lang2_slug":false,"lang2_name":false,"parent_publication_id":35,"featured_image_uri":"","article_title":"Skewing the city","permalink":"skewing-the-city","article_subtitle":"","article_abstract":"","article_summary":"","article_text":"<p>Where parks, boulevards and towering skyscrapers now await an increasing influx of inhabitants, not so long ago there used to be only water, just plain, grey ocean. On 610 hectares (2.35 square miles) of reclaimed land in the greater Seoul area, at a projected cost of US$35 (\u20ac27) billion, Songdo City is being built from scratch. Conceived in the wake of the Asian economic crisis, the city is located in a free economic zone and intended to become an important business hub in Northeast Asia. A 7.5 mile (12 km) long suspension bridge connects Songdo with Incheon International Airport, placing it within an hour or two from many major metropolitan areas in the region: the ideal place to set out from for an afternoon business meeting in Tokyo or a weekend shopping spree in Shanghai. Songdo has been hailed as a \u2018city of the future\u20191, and as an \u2018experimental prototype community of tomorrow\u20192. As a complete greenfield development, it stands the unique chance of becoming one of the first genuinely smart and ubiquitous cities, and thus a role model for similar projects all over the world, designed to house the hundreds of millions who are projected to move into cities in the near future.<\/p>\n<p>The vision for Songdo is largely technological, driven by an engineering perspective. In recent years, a number of companies have recognised the apparently huge potential for modern information technologies to transform the cityscape. IBM has launched its Smarter Planet initiative, for example, while Siemens has established a fourth company sector focusing on infrastructure and cities. Cisco, an American company specialising in networking equipment, is heavily investing in urban innovations with its Smart+Connected Communities programme. Cisco in particular is heavily involved in Songdo and considers it a \u2018model for smart cities around the globe\u20193.<\/p>\n<p>Cisco\u2019s brochures summarise the central idea behind building smart cities with a remarkable statement: \u2018the foundation for the city of the future will be the network and the information it carries\u20194. Supposedly, one starts with the network and everything else will follow. Of course, this network has a technological component that links up with different infrastructure systems, like transport, health care, education, or energy. But in the end it will serve the needs of the people, support the social networks in the city and beyond. This essay is an attempt to elaborate on the issues that are involved in a vision of the city as network5.<\/p>\n<h1>Connecting people through things<\/h1>\n<p>Looming in the background is the familiar vision of the Internet of Things, which predicts an extension of the Internet into ever more realms of the physical world. An increasing number of objects will be recognisable through ID tags, will be equipped with sensors to collect information, and will, through radio transmitters, be integrated into the larger network. Supposedly, this will create smart and sensing environments that can adjust to human needs in sophisticated ways. There will be a steady flow of information that links the physical with the social world and the data cloud. To a considerable extent, the Internet of Things has already become reality. Many mobile phones or CCTV cameras are integrated in this network now, and other objects, like cars or televisions, are likely to follow soon. In Songdo, IT specialists experiment with tele-presence systems that are supposed to deliver education, healthcare, and government services directly into the homes. Lampposts equipped with public Wi-Fi, CCTV and information services are set up all over the city.<\/p>\n<p>As the Internet expands, the principles that now govern the digital world will increasingly determine the physical world and the conditions of urban living. The infrastructural networks will become increasingly autonomous and less dependent on human intervention. And yet, their ultimate purpose remains to connect people and their needs. As the techno-social networks around us grow tighter, the social and the technological spheres will become increasingly interdependent. The data stored in the networks will make our steps through the cityscape increasingly predictable and, eventually, also controllable.<\/p>\n<h1>The skewed city<\/h1>\n<p>From a social perspective, objective physical space has always been an illusion, if a persistent one6. Networks are a much more adequate representation of the social world; of friendships, romantic relationships, family bonds, or professional interactions. Humans pertain to a large number of highly complex and interconnected networks. Each of these comes equipped with its own metric system, determining the distances between the various actors in society. These metrics often differ enormously from each other between networks and also from physical space. Indeed, most social networks are only remotely constrained by their physical substrate: one may live at a distance of a thousand miles from a good friend, but in terms of a friendship network be direct neighbours.<\/p>\n<p>A major force driving infrastructural evolution has consisted in the need to overcome the various restrictions imposed by physical space in order to enable more flexible social networks. With regards to communication, the advent of the Internet is certainly one of the biggest leaps towards making physical distances irrelevant.<\/p>\n<p>As modern information infrastructure allows citizens to become enmeshed in a growing number of ever more complex and interconnected networks, traditional places and boundaries of the social sphere rearrange themselves, or completely disappear. With respect to physical space, the network structures of the city become increasingly skewed. Once familiar locations, like the library, the travel agency, the flea market or the department store, lose their spatial reference points and dissolve into a diffuse data cloud. Long established boundaries, which were once all referenced by physical space, between home and work, the public and the private, the commercial and the non-branded, or the urban and the rural, become increasingly blurry. <\/p>\n<h1>The network as carrier of social evolution<\/h1>\n<p>To further emphasise why networks are so important for understanding the social dimension of city life, it is useful to refer to a somewhat obscure social theory developed by the French sociologist Gabriel Tarde in the last decades of the nineteenth century. Tarde insisted that everything social results from repeated imitation, which is only occasionally interrupted by more or less ingenious invention. The theory holds the germ of a powerful idea, recently popularised through Oxford biologist Richard Dawkin\u2019s concept of the <em>meme<\/em>7. In an analogy to the gene, a <em>meme<\/em> is the basic entity that drives cultural and social development according to evolutionary principles. Supposedly, evolution is not restricted to the genome but results whenever the following conditions are fulfilled: there must be a) a copying mechanism, b) the possibility for mutations in a copy, and c) a selection mechanism that singles out those copies that are particularly well adapted to the environment.<\/p>\n<p>If Tarde were right and much of the dynamics of the social sphere is guided by imitation, then the development of traditions and customs should indeed follow evolutionary principles, but also the development of more specific everyday, professional, or even technological skills. There is little reason to doubt the significance of imitation to our social lives. From the first days in this world, throughout the various phases of education and training, we are constantly copying skills and behaviours from others: from role models in the family, among friends, at school, or at work. And only every once in a while we step back and try to reflect on what we are actually doing, often in an attempt to introduce small mutations in order to optimise.<\/p>\n<p>Why is this perspective on social evolution relevant for the view of the city as network? Because social networks have in essence become the topologies that determine the dynamics of imitation. Copies of certain ideas and behaviour are now mainly exchanged via the links of social networks. Network structures thus determine who can serve as role model, and from whom we can imitate. It is therefore crucial to grasp the basic principles of the networks in which we are entangled.<\/p>\n<h1>A science of networks<\/h1>\n<p>Until the 1990s, graph or network theory was largely a mathematical specialism with very few everyday or real-world applications. This changed completely with the advent of the computer and its power to analyse large datasets, and also with the emergence of the Internet and the World Wide Web as examples of large network structures. Today, the study of real-world networks has become a major industry in various scientific fields, including biology, engineering, and the social sciences8.<\/p>\n<p>The emerging science of networks has helped unearth some general principles that are realised in many social and technological networks. Most networks arise from feedback mechanisms, for example, where the simple fact that a certain node already has a large number of links increases the probability that it will acquire new ones, in the same way as a person who already has many friends is likely to make new friends more easily: not because he is such a great guy, but just because it is nice to have popular friends. As a result of such feedback mechanisms many networks have a similar structure: with very few extensively linked nodes, and a large majority of nodes with only a small number of links.<\/p>\n<p>If we follow that principle, obnoxious YouTube videos apparently become viral not so much due to their content, but somewhat paradoxically due to their very popularity. Also, the rise of websites like Amazon, Facebook, eBay or Google is due in part to feedback mechanisms, and a subsequent winner-takes-it-all phenomenon. These are obvious examples, in which changes in network structure have a decisive impact on economic and social conditions9. As the Internet expands into the physical world, one can only speculate on how the basic principles of large-scale networks will further transform our social and cultural lives.<\/p>\n<h1>Linking things and data<\/h1>\n<p>A number of interesting questions arise in connection with the integration of objects into the Internet. Will future smart and sensing infrastructures have a memory of past interactions, like websites like Amazon, Google or Facebook now have? Will these infrastructures at one point become personalised10, as those websites are, presenting a best guess of what a user wants on the basis of their history? Such, and similar possibilities are already being explored at innovative research centres like the Media Lab11 at MIT. It is quite plausible that smart infrastructures will one day, in the not too distant future, be so flexible as to predict and respond to specific user needs. Simple examples may be adaptive lighting in public places, or adaptive driving behaviour of cars.<\/p>\n<p>This sketch of some general features of the networked city and society leaves us in a better position to assess if places like Songdo indeed constitute a step towards the city of the future. Songdo seems determined by an engineering vision, by the technologically possible. However, at least up to its current state of development, it largely fails to address the social ramifications that are directly implied by the technological innovations used. Future city designs will have to more profoundly consider certain topics, like the shift in spatial relations implied by changing network structures, or the increasing dissolution of familiar social spaces and boundaries. They will also have to take into account that cityscapes will become increasingly dominated by the flexible, personalised, and responsive infrastructures that are a direct consequence of the Internet of Things. All these developments lead to a further merging of the social and the technical spheres, eventually realising a cyborg vision of the city as a complex socio-technical network.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"<p><strong>Endnotes<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>1 http:\/\/www.bbc.com\/travel\/feature\/20120313-business-trip-seoul<\/p>\n<p>2 Lindsay, G.

The streets of Tepito are full of worshippers, upwards of 2,000 people moving excitedly in anticipation of seeing and possibly touching La Grande, a lifesize statue of the Santa Muerte or saint of death. Looking to all intents like the Grim Reaper, La Santa represents a \u2018crisis religion\u2019, with devotees identified as the victims of the neo-liberal economy: she is popular among drug addicts and dealers, former prisoners and gang members. Mingling in the crowds of Tepito are heavily tattooed men, in every appearance hardcore gang members, except that they are bringing their babies to La Grande, delicately placing a cigarette at the baby\u2019s lips to cast smoke over the shrine.<\/p>\n<p>But La Santa\u2019s supporters go beyond these stereotypes. A friend\u2019s uncle, a millionaire businessman, has replaced the conventional Virgin of Guadalupe altar in his house with one to La Santa. At the Sonora market in La Merced, the stallholders selling the statues \u2013 red for love, gold for wealth, black for protection, and the powders for the devotions \u2013 claim a broad clientele. In these times of economic uncertainty, of a state no longer willing to be associated with terms such as \u2018welfare\u2019, with families split by the 20 million Mexicans living in the US, everyone needs some form of social attachment.<\/p>\n<p>Elsewhere, the scenes are a little different but essentially the same. In a Brazilian favela located on a rubbish dump a mae-de-santo (Mother of Saints) receives visitors to divine their life-paths through the interpretation of cowrie shells. The old woman has a steady stream of clients, keen to understand their futures but also grateful that believing in something provides the necessary motivations to be \u2018healthy\u2019. In a favela racked with drug addiction, alcoholism, tuberculosis, dengue or \u2018nerves\u2019, this concern with health extends beyond the spiritual.<\/p>\n<p>In S\u00e3o Paulo, religion is also central to a reanimation of social life. Neo-Pentecostalism is the fastest growing religion in Brazil, with 24 million faithful (four times as many as in the US). The March for Jesus organised by the Renascer em Cristo church recently brought together over one million people for a daylong festival of faith. Many of those in attendance are drawn by the messages of hard work, family, moral integrity \u2013 disseminated by the Record Network of television and radio channels run by the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God. These messages speak well to people whose \u2018faith\u2019 in other religions has been shaken by links to political corruption, abuse and indifference.<\/p>\n<p>Religion offers salvation in many forms. Among Latin America\u2019s numerous gangs, the 80,000 members of the Mara in San Salvador, Guatemala City and Tegucigalpa, or the parche in Bogot\u00e1 and malandros in Caracas, conversion to Protestantism is the only way to leave your jombois, and avoid the \u2018exit beatings\u2019 dished out to people requesting to become a calmado (quiet one). Even then the decision is not taken lightly. In many cities gangs are the principal form of social engagement among young people. In Villa El Salvador, Lima, 70 per cent of inhabitants are under 25 years old but fewer than 15 per cent have access to some form of higher or technical education. The gang is the focal point of social relations. Gang members congregate on vacant plots or corners, swapping stories, drinking, dealing drugs, discussing the latest styles of music or dress that might identify them as skatos, crew or punk. Their relations with community leaders, the police and rival gangs define the feeling of the barrio. Their use of tagging and graffiti may define the barrio\u2019s territorial boundaries, and more likely by drawing from scripts through US and Japanese spray styles of cartoons and popular imagery the barrio gains an aesthetic.<\/p>\n<p>Deemed \u2018anti social\u2019 by those who fear leaving home or departing from fixed routes that make conviviality difficult, to its members the gang is hyper social. But rumour and gossip do travel. In dense squatter settlements with houses constructed from rudimentary materials there are few secrets. Local bosses or gangs know of the domestic violence, the adultery, drug taking or alcoholism, they learn of the debtors and neighbours with disputes over noise, thefts or property lines. Although complicit in these problems, the boss or gang is also the route to conflict resolution. In Rocinha, the archetypical favela holding onto a Rio de Janeiro hillside, the local drug gangs mediate disputes, sometimes working with NGOs. A programme known as \u2018Balcao do Direitos\u2019 that organises favelados to apply for their registration papers involved the Rio Law School and the agreement of the major gangs. A drug gang\u2019s decision is final and non-compliance is not recommended. Though not always fair, people have less reason to believe that a gang\u2019s verdict will be any less just than a judge\u2019s, and their decision will be arrived at more quickly and cheaply. In Rio it costs less to have someone killed than to arrange an illegal hook up to the electricity supply. Summary justice can be ruthless, but gangs also impose norms to prevent favelados resorting to individual violence.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_59\" style=\"width: 406px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/08\/08_SA08Ref_Jones2.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-59\" title=\"Family in Rocinha, a favela in Rio de Janeiro\" src=\"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/08\/08_SA08Ref_Jones2.jpg\" alt=\"Family in Rocinha, a favela in Rio de Janeiro\" width=\"396\" height=\"425\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">In Rocinha, a favela in Rio de Janeiro with a population estimated between 100,000 and 1,000,000, there is an active tradition of providing for one\u2019s own urbanity according to informal and organic interventions.<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":"http:\/\/v0.urban-age.net\/0_downloads\/archive\/_SA\/09_NewsPaper_Essay_Jones.pdf","article_publishing_date":"December 2008","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"9","name":"Gareth","created":"2011-08-30 12:51:54","modified":"2011-08-30 13:51:54","slug":"jones-gareth","family_name":"Jones","title":null,"email_address":null,"photo_legacy":null,"profile_text":"<p>Gareth Jones is a Senior Lecturer at the London School of Economics, an Associate Fellow at the Institute for the Study of the Americas at University College London, and co-editor of the Journal of Latin American Studies.<\/p>","organization":"","role":"","additional_affiliations":null,"qualifications":null,"staff_pages_blurb":null,"office_location":null,"display_after":null,"display_until":null,"extended_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb_lang2":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation_lang2":null,"phone_number":null}],"attachments":false,"gallery":{"slug":false,"extra_classes":"","slides":[]}},{"request_language":"","current_page_uri":"\/media\/search-dev.json","lang2_slug":false,"lang2_name":false,"parent_publication_id":5,"featured_image_uri":"","article_title":"South: Elephant & Castle","permalink":"south-elephant-castle","article_subtitle":"Changing Values","article_abstract":"","article_summary":"","article_text":"<p>Elephant &amp; Castle occupies the geographical centre of London in a highly dynamic and gritty part of the city.

However, in China, the improvement of health services is of much lower priority than efforts to build factories and transport infrastructure in order to generate and sustain the levels of economic growth that has come to define the country\u2019s hyper-urbanisation. The resulting spatial structure of rapidly growing megacities in China, coupled with its institutional history, creates a distinct relationship between urban density and health care services within and between the core and peripheral areas of cities, including Shanghai.<\/p>\n<p>What follows is an account of the spatial disparity of health care services in Shanghai. In the context of government-orchestrated decentralisation, I focus on how two salient features of demographic dynamics \u2013 ageing and migration \u2013 interact to create a set of challenges to the provision of spatially balanced and adequate health care to all Shanghai residents.<\/p>\n<p>Due to the institutional legacy of urban-rural separation in China that favoured investment and services in cities, urban areas have better health facilities than rural ones. For the same reason, large cities have enjoyed better health care services than small cities and towns. In most Chinese cities, there is a greater concentration of health care facilities in the urban core than in the outskirts and administratively linked rural areas beyond. Take Shanghai, for example. Despite, or perhaps because of, a large population and high density at its centre, health service per capita is higher than in the suburban and rural areas. In Jing\u2019an District, located in downtown Shanghai, there were 559 hospital beds and 317 physicians per square kilometre in 2006, 41 and 53 times higher respectively than Shanghai\u2019s average. In the city centre, the number of hospital beds and physicians per 1,000 people was two to three times the average of the Shanghai municipality and five to six times its suburban areas. The urban core of Shanghai can thus considered \u2018healthier\u2019 than the outlying and rural areas within its municipal boundary, in relation to its greater availability of health services \u2013 one of the most important determinants of urban health.<\/p>\n<p>Since the 1990s, Shanghai has experienced large-scale and accelerated suburbanisation and decentralisation, characterised by the construction of a number of new towns or satellite cities that are supposed to be environmentally friendly, international and rich with commercial and social services. This trend has both facilitated and reflected some spatial dispersal of central city population. The extension of railways and roads has induced more polycentric urban development, since people living in suburban cities can easily travel to work on public transportation or by the growing number of private cars. Between the fifth national Census taken in 2000 and the sixth Census recently completed in 2010, the population of Shanghai\u2019s urban districts grew only slightly from 6.93 million to 6.99 million. Meanwhile, the population in the suburban districts rose by 70 per cent, from 10.72 million to 17.34 million. Suburban growth was more rapid in Minghang District and Pudong New Area, and most rapid in Songjiang District and Jiading District, where Songjiang New City and Jiading New City are located, whose populations have doubled in ten years.<\/p>\n<p>This accelerated suburban population growth makes the already inferior health facilities and services in those areas even more deficient. It not only lowers the access of people living in these new suburban communities to heath care but also reduces the appeal of these places to central city residents who contemplate moving. This disparity is particularly problematic for the elderly population. While the average proportion of population aged 65 and above in Shanghai was around 10 per cent in 2010, it rises to 16\u201317 per cent in central urban districts such as Jing\u2019an and Luwan, and drops to 6\u20137 per cent in suburban districts such as Jiading, Songjiang and Qingpu. The greater concentration of the older population in the central city can be expected, given their higher demand for health services, amongst other factors. However, it puts strain on old-age care facilities in the central city, where waiting times for nursing homes can reach several years. In contrast, there are often empty beds at nursing homes in the suburban and rural areas. Given the low standard and conditions of nursing homes in rural areas, the elderly in the central city are reluctant to move to those facilities. Therefore, building higher quality health facilities for the old in suburban new cities is an important step in encouraging them, and indeed all age groups, to move.<\/p>\n<p>The continued growth of internal migrant populations in large coastal cities like Shanghai, especially in its outlying areas, poses another challenge to city healthcare, a key factor in the creation of sustainable urban communities. Due to China\u2019s hukou system and its associated discrimination against migrants accessing public services, migrants do not have the same rights to medical care as local residents. As a result, and even though many migrants have lived in Shanghai for a long time, most of them do not have medical insurance and cannot afford to pay for the relatively high health service in Shanghai. The non-hukou migrant population who live more than half a year in Shanghai numbers almost nine million of the estimated 23 million people living permanently in the city. This means there is a huge population living and working in the city which is not able to access equal health care. This disparity creates a major source of potential social discontent and, over time, a less healthy workforce.<\/p>\n<p>The inequality of public health services in the megacity of Shanghai has two sources. The first is the unequal geographic distribution of health care resources and facilities between the traditionally favored central city and the newly developed, but still less serviced, periphery. This disparity has been exasperated by the rapid relocation of central city population to the suburban areas. The solution should be to rebalance the spatial distribution of health care facilities, and to provide high quality health services in suburban areas, in proportion to population dynamics and shifting density aligned with better planning mechanisms. Second, inequality in health care is based on the unequal rights of different population groups, especially between local residents and migrants, and is also complicated by the issue of class. This raises an urgent need for municipal government to provide universal public health service to all people, especially for those migrants who have contributed a great deal to Shanghai\u2019s prosperity. Only then can the opportunities of health as a driver for sustainable urban development be fully realised.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"<p>The author would like to acknowledge the comments and editorial support of Professor Xiangming Chen.<\/p>\n","pdf_uri":"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/11\/2011_chw_5055_Ren.pdf","article_publishing_date":"November 2011","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"128","name":"Yuan","created":"2011-11-04 11:38:55","modified":"2011-11-04 11:38:55","slug":null,"family_name":"Ren","title":null,"email_address":null,"photo_legacy":null,"profile_text":null,"organization":null,"role":null,"additional_affiliations":null,"qualifications":null,"staff_pages_blurb":null,"office_location":null,"display_after":null,"display_until":null,"extended_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb_lang2":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation_lang2":null,"phone_number":null}],"attachments":false,"gallery":{"slug":false,"extra_classes":"","slides":[]}},{"request_language":"","current_page_uri":"\/media\/search-dev.json","lang2_slug":false,"lang2_name":false,"parent_publication_id":11,"featured_image_uri":"","article_title":"Tarlaba\u015f\u0131","permalink":"tarlabasi","article_subtitle":"","article_abstract":"<p>Tolga \u0130slam summarises the development pressures threatening one of Istanbul\u2019s historic neighbourhoods.<\/p>\n","article_summary":"","article_text":"<p><div id=\"attachment_744\" style=\"width: 379px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-744\" title=\"14_00\" src=\"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/11\/14_00.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"369\" height=\"419\" \/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">With plans of a major face-lift project to parts of the deprived district, Tarlaba\u015f\u0131 may lose the social bonds that come from its fine urban tissue.<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Tarlaba\u015f\u0131 is a mixed-use neighbourhood located a few hundred metres from \u0130stiklal Street, the cultural hub of the city. The area is mostly composed of four- and five-storey historic buildings dating back to the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries. Tarlaba\u015f\u0131 was originally inhabited by non-Muslim minorities (Greeks and Armenians) who moved out of the neighbourhood after the changed political framework of the 1940s that excluded minorities. They were replaced by rural migrants from central and northern parts of the country in the rapid industrialisation and urbanisation era of the post 1950s. The area attracted another wave of migrants in the 1990s: this time from the Kurds escaping civil war in the south-eastern parts of the country. Tarlaba\u015f\u0131 has also become host to African migrants, Romans and transsexuals.<\/p>\n<p>The construction of a large boulevard in the late 1980s cut the connection and increased the disparity between Tarlabasi and its immediate surroundings, especially with \u0130stiklal Street, the cultural centre. Today, dilapidated after years of neglect, Tarlaba\u015f\u0131 is a highly stigmatised neighbourhood, deemed \u2018dangerous\u2019 by the general public. Despite its close proximity to the cultural centre, the area has managed to miss the wave of gentrification and investment that has been taking place since the 1990s around \u0130stiklal Street (i.e. Galata, Cihangir, Asmalimescit).<\/p>\n<p>Around 20,000 square metres, consisting of 9 blocks and 278 plots, in Tarlaba\u00fe\u00fd were declared a regeneration area by the Council of Ministers in February 2006 following a petition from the local municipality. The recently released renewal law, Law 5366, LAW for the Protection of Deteriorated Historic and Cultural Heritage through Renewal and Re-use, forms the basis of the renewal process in Tarlaba\u00fe\u00fd as well as in many other neighbourhoods within the historic city. The law makes the renewal of dilapidated areas in historic neighbourhoods possible through new expropriation powers given to the local authorities to implement renewal projects for several blocks without the consent of the property owners.<\/p>\n<p>The renewal process in Tarlaba\u015f\u0131 formally started when a private development company, GAP \u0130n\u015faat, won the bid for the preparation and implementation of the area\u2019s redevelopment in April 2007. GAP \u0130n\u015faat\u2019s offer represented the largest, leaving 42 per cent of the current floor area for the existing owners after renewal. Seven local architectural firms, some of the leading offices in the city, have been subcontracted by GAP \u0130n\u015faat to prepare projects according to the proposed plan to transform the area into a mixed-use development with luxury residential units, shopping centres, cafes and hotels.<\/p>\n<p>The proposed plan, however, has met with resistance from the majority of residents. In 2008 the owners, landlords and renters came together and established an association to oppose renewal. They claim that the current offer of the development company is not fair and demand better conditions. So far they have managed to freeze the process for now.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":"","article_publishing_date":"November 2009","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"32","name":"Tolga","created":"2011-10-04 14:03:28","modified":"2011-10-04 15:05:16","slug":null,"family_name":"\u0130slam","title":null,"email_address":null,"photo_legacy":null,"profile_text":"","organization":"","role":"","additional_affiliations":null,"qualifications":null,"staff_pages_blurb":null,"office_location":null,"display_after":null,"display_until":null,"extended_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb_lang2":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation_lang2":null,"phone_number":null}],"attachments":false,"gallery":{"slug":false,"extra_classes":"","slides":[]}},{"request_language":"","current_page_uri":"\/media\/search-dev.json","lang2_slug":false,"lang2_name":false,"parent_publication_id":19,"featured_image_uri":"","article_title":"The African Centre for Cities\u2019 Healthy Cities CityLab","permalink":"the-african-centre-for-cities%e2%80%99-healthy-cities-citylab","article_subtitle":"Understanding Urban Health in the Global South","article_abstract":"","article_summary":"","article_text":"<p>Like most other cities of the global South, Cape Town\u2019s 3.7 million people live in a juxtaposition of wealth and poverty, of formality and informality.

The most recent age-standardised mortality rate for Cape Town is 1,011 per 100,000 people. This is considerably higher than in most cities in the global North, for example, it is 60 per cent higher than the latest mortality rate for New York City. Health indicators also vary enormously between health districts, for example, the mortality rate for communicable diseases is about five times higher in the Khayelitsha Health District than in the Southern Peninsula Health District (550 deaths per 100,000 people per year versus 112).<\/p>\n<p>The burden of disease in Cape Town and other South African cities is particularly complex and, as such, is known as a \u2018quadruple burden of disease\u2019, which consists of:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Communicable diseases, closely linked to poverty, such as tuberculosis and diarrhoea (which are both in the top ten causes of premature mortality in Cape Town), continue at high levels. Many of these diseases are linked to overcrowding, inadequate shelter, inadequate access to basic services and inadequate access to affordable and healthy food.<\/li>\n<li>HIV\/AIDS, which is the leading cause of premature mortality in Cape Town.<\/li>\n<li>Chronic diseases of lifestyle, such as diabetes mellitus and ischaemic heart disease (which are both in the top ten causes of premature mortality in Cape Town), are growing rapidly. These are linked to changes in lifestyle associated with rural-urban migration as well as the transition of some households to more affluent lifestyles. These transitions result in more sedentary lifestyles, growing obesity and increased risk of non-communicable diseases.<\/li>\n<li>Injuries. Cape Town has particularly high levels of murder and traffic accidents, which are the second and fourth most frequent causes respectively of premature mortality in Cape Town.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Improving the health and well-being of residents of Cape Town is a challenge. The limited health data that is available is out of date and difficult for policy-makers to engage with. The high levels of political contestation in Cape Town have tended towards policy-makers focusing on the short-term and on tangible forms of delivery such as housing and infrastructure.<\/p>\n<p>Cape Town and other South African cities are undergoing large-scale state-driven transformation through national programmes for the provision of low-income housing, infrastructure and the renewal of low-income residential areas. Improving health is not an explicit objective in any of these programmes and evaluations of some interventions suggest that they can sometimes have a negative impact on households. An ongoing illustration is where relocation to the urban periphery results in the disruption of livelihoods strategies and social support networks, with very negative impacts on the health and well-being of residents. For example, the relocation of residents from a well-located informal settlement in Langa, close to central Cape Town, to a relocation area in Delft, about 15 kilometres (9 miles) away, resulted in 20 per cent of households losing a source of income, and up to a five-fold increase in monthly transport costs for those who retained their jobs. While there are exceptions, many new housing projects still tend to provide sterile living environments that are not conducive to mental health or to safe outdoor activity, both in terms of aesthetic appeal and protection from hazards, such as traffic, crime and flooding. It is therefore of crucial importance that we have a better understanding of how the physical urban environment influences health and well-being, so that we can begin to create cities that are more conducive to the health and well-being of all residents.<\/p>\n<p>Literature on the relationship between the physical urban environment and health suggests a number of important linkages, and possible interventions, that can improve health and well-being. These linkages that potentially have implications for interventions in the built environment and the design and layout of new housing areas include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The provision and design of housing and infrastructure. Improving housing conditions and access to services by, for example, slum upgrading programmes can improve health and well-being in multiple ways.<\/li>\n<li>The food environment. For example, the nature and location of food outlets can influence diet and nutrition, and the location and nature of spaces for urban agriculture can also be important.<\/li>\n<li>Appropriate planning layouts. The design of streets and public spaces can create urban environments that are safer from violent crime and traffic accidents, while access to green space can have a positive impact on mental health.<\/li>\n<li>Design and physical activity. Research suggests that certain types of built environments are more conducive to physical activity like walking, cycling and recreation, and can potentially result in improved health outcomes.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>However, the existing bodies of knowledge on the relationship between human health and the physical urban environment are overwhelmingly based on empirical work undertaken in the global North, and the concepts of \u2018health\u2019 and \u2018the urban\u2019 that underpin this body of knowledge are also derived largely from the particular historical and cultural contexts of the global North. The many manuals on how to create healthy urban environments are therefore of limited use in cities such as Cape Town, where contextual realities are often very different to those in the global North, and where many of the underlying assumptions do not necessarily apply.<\/p>\n<p>In response to this partial disjuncture between our contextual realities and the bodies of knowledge on the relationship between human health and the physical urban environment, the African Centre for Cities at the University of Cape Town established its Healthy Cities CityLab programme to bring researchers from different disciplines at the University of Cape Town together in a long-term interdisciplinary applied research programme on the relationship between the physical urban environment and health and well-being in Cape Town. The Healthy Cities CityLab is one of a number of the African Centre for Cities\u2019 CityLabs, which stimulate policy-relevant research, and researcher-practitioner engagement, on various key challenges facing Cape Town.<\/p>\n<p>The key components of the first phase of the research programme include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Undertaking body-mapping workshops in different types of neighbourhoods, such as informal settlements and new housing projects, to determine grassroots perceptions of health and well-being.<\/li>\n<li>Undertaking an analysis of current key institutional structures, policies and practices that relate to urban health in Cape Town, using interviews and documentation.<\/li>\n<li>Engaging with policy-makers and practitioners in order to explore ways of incorporating explicit health and well-being objectives into policy and implementation processes.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This research programme is ongoing, but there are a number of key issues which have emerged thus far.<\/p>\n<p>First, many of the implicit assumptions about what an \u2018urban environment\u2019 is are integrally rooted in the Western modernist conception of cities. For example, instruments for measuring \u2018walkability\u2019 assume that there are clearly defined streets, plots or dwelling units and land uses, and that there are clear separations between urban and rural, residential and commercial, and public and private. African urbanism, on the other hand, is characterised by informality and complexity and the lack of neat separations. In the informal settlements found in African cities, for example, there are no clearly defined streets and no clear separations between vehicle space and pedestrian space, between public and private space, and between land uses; residential dwellings are often also the site of home-based enterprises. Similarly, plots and dwelling units are not clearly defined and even the idea of the \u2018household\u2019 can be fairly fluid, with extended families spread across urban and rural homes and with frequent movement between them. All of this can make the relationship between residents and their neighbourhood environment far more complex than in the conventional conception of the Western modern city. The main implication of this is that some of the tools relied on to create healthier urban environments in cities of the global North, such as land-use zoning schemes, will have only a limited effect in cities of the global South, where large segments of cities fall outside the ambit of formal regulations. In Cape Town and other cities of the global South there needs to be more emphasis on guiding the physical creation and management of the urban environment through participatory processes that involve both formal and informal structures.<\/p>\n<p>Second, much of the body of knowledge on the relationship between the urban environment and health rests on an underlying implicit assumption about choice and the availability of alternative options. In contexts such as Cape Town, with high levels of poverty and inequality, and with entrenched socio-spatial segregation and distorted property markets that do not function in most of the city, these assumptions about choice in terms of where to live and choice of lifestyle do not necessarily hold. The implication of this is that the health care promotion programmes that try to change the lifestyles of residents (for example, physical activity and diet) that have been implemented in many cities of the global North may be less effective in cities of the global South. Given the constraints on freedom of choice in many cities of the global South, physical interventions, such as creating safer streets and public spaces and creating healthier food markets and suitable spaces for urban agriculture, would seem to be essential preconditions for health promotion programmes.<\/p>\n<p>Third, as is the case with most other cities of the global South, available health data on Cape Town is fragmented, out of date and often cannot be disaggregated down to fine-grained scales. This makes it difficult for policy-makers to recognise urban health issues as a priority, and makes it difficult to monitor the health impact of interventions in the urban environment. Cheap and effective methodologies for the collection, analysis and monitoring of relevant urban health data need to be explored.<\/p>\n<p>Creating healthier urban environments is primarily about governance, politics and decision-making. It is crucial to ensure that policy-makers are aware of key health issues, such as health inequity levels, and how the physical urban environment contributes to this, and how interventions that would not necessarily involve more expenditure, just differently distributed, can contribute to improving health and well-being for all.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/11\/2011_chw_5065_Smit-Watson.pdf","article_publishing_date":"November 2011","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"130","name":"Warren","created":"2011-11-04 11:41:17","modified":"2011-11-04 11:41:17","slug":null,"family_name":"Smit","title":null,"email_address":null,"photo_legacy":null,"profile_text":null,"organization":null,"role":null,"additional_affiliations":null,"qualifications":null,"staff_pages_blurb":null,"office_location":null,"display_after":null,"display_until":null,"extended_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb_lang2":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation_lang2":null,"phone_number":null},{"id":"131","name":"Vanessa","created":"2011-11-04 11:41:28","modified":"2013-01-22 17:27:30","slug":"watson-vanessa","family_name":"Watson","title":"","email_address":"","photo_legacy":"","profile_text":"<p>Vanessa Watson is Professor and Deputy Dean of the Faculty of Engineering and the Built Environment at the University of Cape Town.<\/p>","organization":"","role":"","additional_affiliations":"","qualifications":"","staff_pages_blurb":"","office_location":"","display_after":"","display_until":"","extended_blurb":"","special_2012ec_blurb":"","special_2012ec_affiliation":"","special_2013rio_blurb":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb_lang2":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation_lang2":null,"phone_number":null}],"attachments":false,"gallery":{"slug":false,"extra_classes":"","slides":[]}},{"request_language":"","current_page_uri":"\/media\/search-dev.json","lang2_slug":false,"lang2_name":false,"parent_publication_id":35,"featured_image_uri":"","article_title":"The Benefits of Density","permalink":"the-benefits-of-density","article_subtitle":"","article_abstract":"","article_summary":"","article_text":"<p>In the 1970s, Jane Jacobs argued that we could minimise our damage to the environment by clustering together in high-rises and walking to work, and this point has been eloquently argued by David Owen in his book <em>Green Metropolis<\/em> (2009). We maximise our damage when we insist on living surrounded by greensward. Lower densities inevitably mean more travel, and that requires energy. While larger living spaces certainly do have their advantages, large suburban homes also consume much more energy. Anyone who believes that global warming is a real danger should see dense urban living as part of the solution. Over the next fifty years, China and India will cease to be poor rural nations, and that&#8217;s a good thing. They \u2013 like the United States and Europe before them \u2013 will move from rural to urban living. If billions of Chinese and Indians insist on leafy suburbs and the large homes and cars those suburbs entail, then the world&#8217;s carbon emissions will soar. The critical question is whether, as Asia develops, it will become a continent of suburban drivers or urban public-transit users. <\/p>\n<p>Matthew Kahn and I have put together a carbon inventory of new housing throughout the United States. We wanted to determine the amount of carbon emissions that come from building a typical new home in different parts of the country, so we based our estimates primarily on homes built over the last two decades. About 20 per cent of the US&#8217;s carbon dioxide emissions are related to residential energy use, and almost another 20 per cent are associated with our motor vehicles. An average family in the United States buys about 1,000 gallons (3,785 litres) of petrol a year, which is associated with about ten tons of carbon dioxide. It may be easier to imagine American families buying more fuel-efficient cars than giving up on car-based living altogether, but historically the bulk of variation in petrol usage among various people over various periods of time comes from total distances travelled, not from fuel efficiency. Cars now average about 22 miles per gallon (9.35 km per litre), and the big difference is whether you drive 300 miles per year or 30,000, which depends on whether you live in a city or a suburb. Kahn and I found that area density and distance to the city centre are both strongly associated with petrol usage. The average household living in a census tract with more than 10,000 people per square mile (3,861 per km<sup>2<\/sup>) uses 687 gallons (2,600 litres) of petrol per year, while the average household living in an area with fewer than 1,000 per square mile (386 per km<sup>2<\/sup>) (about one household per acre \/ 4,000 m<sup>2<\/sup>) uses 1,164 gallons (4,406 litres) of petrol per year. <\/p>\n<p>The density of one&#8217;s home neighbourhood matters because most car trips aren&#8217;t commutes downtown. People drive millions of miles to buy groceries, to go out to eat, and to pick their children up from school. The density of shops and schools in an area determines the average distance of those trips. In a city, you often walk to a restaurant. In a low-density area, eating out might entail a 25-minute drive each way. Holding family income and size constant, petrol consumption per family per year declines by 106 gallons (401 litres) as the number of residents per square mile doubles. These facts remind us that mass transit isn&#8217;t the only way to lower petrol consumption. If people lived in denser areas, they&#8217;d travel far smaller distances and use much less petrol, even if they still drove to work. Public transportation emits carbon too, but most forms of public transit are a lot more energy efficient than driving vast distances in our own personal petrol burners. For example, the New York City Transit system uses 42 million gallons (159 million litres) of diesel fuel and 14.8 billion MW of electricity each year to deliver 2.6 billion trips to its riders. That works out to an average of 0.9 pounds of carbon dioxide per trip \u2013 a tenth of the 9 pounds of carbon dioxide emitted in an average car trip. <\/p>\n<p>Kahn and I predicted the amount of petrol that an average family with about US$60,000 (\u20ac46,866) of income would consume in every census tract and every metropolitan area in the country. While every other area in our sample was associated with more than 1,000 gallons (3,785 litres) of petrol per year, the average household in the New York metropolitan area was connected with fewer than 850 gallons (3,217 litres) of petrol per year. While people in the United States as a whole are more than fifteen times as likely to drive themselves to work than use public transportation, New York City residents are more than twice as likely to take mass transit than drive to work. Throughout the country, big cities mean less driving. On average, when population doubles, per-household carbon dioxide emissions due to driving decline by almost a ton per year. In almost every metropolitan area, city dwellers consume a lot less petrol than suburbanites. Predictably, some of the biggest city-suburb gaps are in older areas, like New York, where the average urban family consumes more than 300 gallons (1,136 litres) of petrol less per year than its suburban counterpart. Cities are also greener than suburbs because urbanites use less electricity. Bigger, denser cities, where people own smaller homes, use less electricity. The average single family detached home consumes 88 per cent more electricity than the average apartment in a building of five or more units. The average suburban household consumes 27 per cent more electricity than the average urban household. When we standardise for income and family size, we find that central-city residents use less electricity in 44 out of the 48 metropolitan areas that we analysed. To form a total estimate of household carbon emissions, we just add together the emissions from driving, electricity, and heating, and add public transit. <\/p>\n<p>So how should we interpret all these data? Simply put, if we wanted to reduce emissions by changing our land-development policies, more US residents should live in denser, more urban environments. <\/p>\n<p>Higher-density construction in the United States and Europe will reduce carbon emissions, but the most important battles over urban development in the coming years will be waged in India and China. About half of US homes in 2000 were built between 1970 and 2000, so let&#8217;s assume that about half of America&#8217;s housing stock 30 years from now will also be new. If every pro-density effort is wildly successful in the US, emissions from driving and powering these new houses might fall by 50 per cent. That would be a great achievement, reducing America&#8217;s household carbon emissions by 25 per cent and the US&#8217;s total emissions by 10 per cent. Yet from this momentous shift, world carbon emissions would fall by only 2 per cent. That calculation is not meant to excuse inaction, but rather to make the point that the United States is something of a sideshow in the long-run battle against climate change. The US has trillions of US$ of infrastructure built around the car, and any developed country changes slowly. India and China are changing fast, and they have a lot more people than the US does. If carbon emissions in India and China rose to American per capita levels, the world&#8217;s carbon consumption would increase by 139 per cent, even if their population stayed the same. The biggest environmental benefits from supporting higher-density development in the United States may well be in helping to persuade the Chinese and Indians to build up rather than out. Today, the United States is the world&#8217;s second biggest carbon emitter; on average, Americans emit about 20 metric tons of carbon dioxide per person per year. The Chinese are producing almost 5 tons of carbon dioxide per person per year and the Indians 1 ton. If the Chinese per capita carbon emissions rose to American levels, this would lead to an extra 20 billion tons of carbon emitted every year, increasing world carbon emissions by 69 per cent. <\/p>\n<p>So it&#8217;s essential that we encourage these countries to keep their carbon emissions at the more modest European levels, rather than emulating current American energy use and development patterns. Today, China&#8217;s carbon emissions are largely industrial. Like the black smoke that once surrounded Pittsburgh or Manchester, they are the by-product of a great industrial power on the rise. So far, China&#8217;s households are remarkably parsimonious energy users. Matthew Kahn, Rui Wang, Siqi Zheng and I did a city-by-city analysis of China&#8217;s household carbon emissions, similar to the one that we did for the United States. While the typical household in the Washington DC area generates 43 tons of carbon dioxide per year, the typical Beijing household emits only 3.997 tons \u2013 and Beijing is one of the brownest places in China. In more than 60 per cent of the Chinese cities we examined, carbon dioxide emissions per household ran at 2 tons a year or less. Household emissions in Daqing, China&#8217;s oil capital and brownest city, are one fifth of emissions in San Diego, America&#8217;s greenest city. Chinese household emissions are driven by home heating and electricity. As countries develop, warmth comes first, long before air conditioning. While half of US household emissions reflect personal transportation, only a tenth of Chinese emissions currently come from cars. The relative paucity of driving and air conditioning in China keeps current emission levels low, but we can hardly expect an increasingly prosperous Chinese population to forego the luxuries that Americans take for granted. If anything, the case for air conditioning in India seems even stronger. <\/p>\n<p>A generation ago, both China and India were solidly rural. They did little environmental damage because, like all poor places, they used little energy. Over a fifty-year period, however, they&#8217;re achieving the same industrial and urban transformation that took centuries in the West. The result is an inevitable explosion in energy consumption, which is today helping to drive up oil prices and that could produce extraordinary increases in carbon emissions in the future. There is, however, a middle way that combines prosperity and growth with fewer environmental risks. That path involves high-density urban living, not the cars of American exurbs. Growth patterns in India and China offer both hopeful and disturbing signs. On the plus side, the great cities of both nations are enormously dense. Mumbai has more than 50,000 people per square mile (19,305 per km<sup>2<\/sup>), about double the density of New York City. Kolkata and Bangalore are above 20,000 per square mile (7,722 per km<sup>2<\/sup>). Shenzhen, the rapidly growing metropolis in mainland China, across the water from Hong Kong, has more than 15,000 people per square mile (5,792 per km<sup>2<\/sup>). These densities fit well with buses and trains and lifts, but make car usage practically impossible. The world will be safer if China&#8217;s future involves hyper-dense places made more comfortable with better public transportation and high-rise residences. But there are also warning signs. Car usage in both India and China is soaring. Chinese car ownership hit 60 million vehicles in 2009, with an annual rate of increase of over 30 per cent. A few more 30 per cent years, and China could have 500 million cars by 2020. Meanwhile, India&#8217;s Tata Group made headlines by producing a US$2,500 (\u20ac1,953) car, and Tata&#8217;s cars could put a billion Indians behind a wheel, if they can handle the traffic jams. A billion Indian drivers will emit a lot of carbon.  <\/p>\n<p>There is a powerful whiff of hypocrisy associated with energy-mad Americans \u2013 and I&#8217;m part of this group \u2013 trying to convince Asians to conserve more. One distinguished economist likened it to a \u2018nation of SUV drivers trying to tell a nation of bicyclists not to drive mopeds\u2019. My awkward suburban life is certainly no model of green living. The only way the West can earn any moral authority on global warming is to first get its own house in order. As long as the US leads the developed world in per capita carbon emissions, we&#8217;ll never be able to convince China and India and the rest of the developing world to do anything other than emulate our own energy-intensive lifestyles. The West also needs to embrace a smarter form of environmentalism. In the first phase of environmentalism, when the objective was just to make people care about nature, the exact policy prescription was less important than raising public consciousness. Today the stakes are higher. We need instead to focus on those proposals that will have a meaningful impact on climate change. Smart environmentalism needs to embrace incentives. Ken Livingstone&#8217;s congestion charge showed the power of using prices to get people out of their cars. This can be done in other cities. Fuel efficiency is unlikely to be the only answer, because Jevons&#8217;s paradox reminds us that as engines and appliances get more efficient, they will also be used more. If the future is going to be greener, then it must be more urban. Dense cities offer a means of living that involves less driving and smaller homes to heat and cool. For the sake of humanity and our planet, cities are \u2013 and must be \u2013 the wave of the future.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"<p>This text consists of edited extracts from E.

Where you live makes a difference: evidence from Washington in the United States, for example, found that children living in deprived neighbourhoods were significantly more likely to be obese than those living in more affluent neighbourhoods, even when neighbourhood-level socioeconomic status was taken into account. Most of the research to date has been carried out in the US, Australia and Europe and, therefore, this essay will deal primarily with the challenges facing these childhood populations. In these contexts, concern for children\u2019s well-being has shifted away from communicable diseases to issues of broader well-being such as whether children are gaining the skills, competencies and experiences they need to lead a successful and happy life. There are questions about how relevant or applicable the findings are for many parts of the developing world, where child mortality rates are still high and children\u2019s lifestyles contrast starkly with their Western peers. However, there is growing awareness in China, Japan and India of many of the most prevalent threats faced by Western countries, including childhood obesity, teenage depression and anxiety.<\/p>\n<p>Children\u2019s use of space has changed in the last few decades \u2013 the space they inhabit is shrinking, as they spend more time indoors and being ferried to destinations by car. This stems from a wider risk-aversion in society: fears about crime, traffic and \u2018stranger danger\u2019, as well as increasing availability of home entertainment. Older children travel further afield, and boys tend to be given more freedom to roam than girls.<\/p>\n<p>The built environment of the home and outdoor space immediately surrounding it is therefore of central importance to children\u2019s well-being because of their prolonged exposure to it (at least 16 hours per day). It also influences their health in adulthood: evidence from England and Scotland suggests that poor housing conditions, such as crowding, lack of a private tapped water source and poor ventilation, in childhood is significantly associated with higher mortality in adulthood, in some cases even after controlling for socioeconomic status.<\/p>\n<h3>The home<\/h3>\n<p>Lack of space in the home has been linked to a wide range of impacts, including poor social interaction, low educational achievement and cognitive development, behaviour and socio-emotional problems and poor respiratory health. In Hong Kong\u2019s dense urban environment, for example, personal space appears to be important in influencing children\u2019s academic performance, affording them the space to study. In the UK context, evidence about the health impacts of crowding on children\u2019s health and development have been influential in shaping policies such as the Mayor\u2019s London Housing Strategy.<\/p>\n<p>Housing quality is also important to children\u2019s well-being, being associated with socio-emotional and mental health, cognitive development and respiratory health. Increased noise levels in the home from, for example, street traffic, neighbours or air traffic, seem to be particularly problematic for children, having implications for their physical and mental health, and their behaviour. A study of 1,048 German children found that exposure to road traffic noise at home was significantly associated with higher blood pressure. Insufficient daylight has been found to be related to depressive symptoms, and strong evidence supports a link between children\u2019s asthma\/poor respiratory health and poor air quality, presence of dampness and mould and inability to keep the house warm, as well as between exposure to lead paint and neurological damage in young children, cognitive impairments in adolescence and problems with impulsivity.<\/p>\n<p>There are also more pragmatic aspects of the physical design of housing that can create health risks for children: stairs and steps (associated with falls); windows and balconies (entrapment and falling); pools and ponds (drowning or near drowning); and design\/location of cookers, fires, radiators and other heat sources (burns and scolds). In England, the Housing Health and Safety Rating System includes health hazards for children, and is now being used by local authorities in the regulation and maintenance of new homes to ensure they provide safe environments for children.<\/p>\n<p>Housing type also appears to be relevant for children\u2019s well-being. In Austria, children living in high-density flats are more likely to suffer mental health problems than their counterparts in high-density row housing. This may be because flats, especially in high-rise blocks, fail to provide adequate play opportunities, or because they are linked to depression in women, which has implications for children where these women are mothers. Context and culture is, however, very important here: high-rise living is the norm in many countries, such as Israel and Hong Kong, and very different expectations of what is high and low density exist: ten dwelling units per hectare is considered low density in the Netherlands, and 100 units per hectare high density, compared to ten to 20 dwelling units per hectare for low density and 290 per hectare for high density in Israel.<\/p>\n<h3>The neighbourhood<\/h3>\n<p>Interest in \u2018child-friendly communities\u2019 has grown recently, mainly because of recognition of the importance for children of being outdoors, for unsupervised play and physical activity. Pressure has come from the need to combat rising obesity, which is also linked to mental health.<\/p>\n<p>Child-friendly communities provide safety, through traffic calming devices, such as \u2018home zones\u2019, and opportunities for play, through incorporation of natural features, public art and parks. A Dutch survey of 448 children in ten neighbourhoods found that a considerable proportion of the difference in walking and cycling activity between neighbourhoods could be explained by built environment characteristics such as frequency of sidewalks, pedestrian crossings, frequency of cycle tracks and the number of recreation facilities. Street layouts are also important in encouraging active travel: a study of school children in Norfolk, England, found that children were more likely to walk to school if they had a high density of roads in their neighbourhood. The quality of streets is also important, with a study in Ontario, Canada, finding that presence of street trees were significantly associated with students walking or cycling to school. Safety \u2013 or rather the perception of safety \u2013 and the presence of multiple land uses and facilities are also important factors in encouraging physical activity in children.<\/p>\n<p>There are more mixed findings for urban density. One study of Nanjing, China, found that lower residential densities were associated with more active travel, while a US-based study found the opposite. A review of 13 studies from the US, Australia, Canada, Iceland and Europe, comparing the physical activity levels of rural and urban children, found little evidence of any difference, but some evidence that suburban and \u2018small town\u2019 children were the most active.<\/p>\n<h3>Greenery and parks<\/h3>\n<p>The presence of greenery in the built environment plays a key role in children\u2019s well-being, whether experienced in the immediate residential environment, in play settings or even by viewing it through windows. Children\u2019s contact with greenery and trees in the built environment has been linked to a range of physical, mental, developmental and emotional benefits, including reduced aggression, alleviation of stress, stimulation of creative play and social interaction and speedier recovery from operations. Children with attention deficit disorder, for example, function better after activities in green settings or in green play areas.<\/p>\n<p>Urban parks provide many opportunities for children and young people: free play, exploration of nature, physical activity, improvement of motor and coordination skills, and interaction with other children. Proximity and accessibility of green open spaces to residential areas is positively associated with increased overall levels of physical activity across age groups. The National Institute for Clinical Excellence, which provides guidelines, recommendations and advice on health care and public health to England and Wales, now recommends the incorporation of green spaces in urban development to encourage physical activity.<\/p>\n<h3>Conclusions<\/h3>\n<p>Looking across all the research to date, evidence suggests that to best support children\u2019s well-being the urban built environment should have the following characteristics:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Homes that have sufficient space and good arrangement of space to provide well for privacy;<\/li>\n<li>Buildings with adequate noise and heat insulation, while allowing sufficient ventilation and daylight;<\/li>\n<li>Housing that faces the street and includes small transitional spaces between front doors and footways;<\/li>\n<li>Residential areas that have connected street layouts, incorporating trees and greenery, with features that reduce the speed of cars;<\/li>\n<li>Mixed land uses with plenty of local facilities and parks; and<\/li>\n<li>Play areas that use natural features in an imaginative way.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>However, children also need to be allowed more opportunities to roam free and play outside without interference from adults, a behaviour that can be facilitated by good neighbourhood design. Children whose lives are too controlled may not have the chance to learn some key life skills that are best acquired through self-directed experiences, and may find it increasingly difficult to cope as they grow up. A recent UNICEF review found that countries where children enjoy comparatively high levels of everyday freedom prior to adolescence showed the highest levels of well-being and best outcomes for family and peer relationships. The lives of UK children may now be so constrained that when as adolescents they eventually gain a degree of freedom, they struggle to cope with the responsibility.<\/p>\n<p>It could be argued that governments should be more proactive in providing and shaping the built environment to promote children\u2019s well-being. Alternatively, policy-makers could ensure regulatory controls are more stringent. Some call, for example, for the re-introduction of minimum space standards for housing. These policies are, however, a relatively blunt instrument, and may have a detrimental effect on housing development at a time of housing shortage. Health providers have started to take the built environment seriously. For example, in the UK, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE \u2013 the independent body responsible for national guidelines on health promotion) recommends the incorporation of green spaces within cities as a way of improving health.<\/p>\n<p>More research is needed in order to develop our understanding of the mechanisms by which the built environment affects children\u2019s well-being. But carrying out research in this field is extremely challenging: it is difficult to conduct trials and longitudinal research, which limits the possibility of uncovering causal effects and much research, though informative, cannot be applied to practice. However, there seems to be consensus that the built environment makes a difference. With enough knowledge there is the potential to actively promote the mental health and well-being of children by providing built environments that support their development, help them reach their potential, teach them creativity and problem-solving skills, encourage them to be active and fit, enable them to have good relationships and strong social networks \u2013 ultimately laying the foundations for a happy, successful life.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/11\/2011_chw_4050_Burton.pdf","article_publishing_date":"November 2011","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"117","name":"Elizabeth","created":"2011-11-04 11:27:26","modified":"2011-11-04 11:27:26","slug":null,"family_name":"Burton","title":null,"email_address":null,"photo_legacy":null,"profile_text":null,"organization":null,"role":null,"additional_affiliations":null,"qualifications":null,"staff_pages_blurb":null,"office_location":null,"display_after":null,"display_until":null,"extended_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb_lang2":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation_lang2":null,"phone_number":null}],"attachments":false,"gallery":{"slug":false,"extra_classes":"","slides":[]}},{"request_language":"","current_page_uri":"\/media\/search-dev.json","lang2_slug":"pt-br","lang2_name":"Portuguese (Brasil)","parent_publication_id":1,"featured_image_uri":"","article_title":"The Challenge of Climate Change in Latin America","permalink":"the-challenge-of-climate-change-in-latin-america","article_subtitle":"","article_abstract":"<p>In an overview of various mitigation and adaptation policies, Patricia Romero Lankao summarises why Latin American cities should care about climate change.<\/p>\n","article_summary":"","article_text":"<p><div id=\"attachment_57\" style=\"width: 406px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-57\" title=\"07_SA08Ref_Lankaoe1\" src=\"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/08\/07_SA08Ref_Lankaoe1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"396\" height=\"156\" \/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Air pollution levels in S\u00e3o Paulo are twice as high as those of New York City and London even though Paulistanos have relatively low carbon emissions per capita compared globally.<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Just as Latin American urban centres have registered levels and paths of development different from those prevailing in high-income nations, so too do their trajectories of emissions differ. Carbon emissions per capita in urban areas such as Austin and the District of Columbia are 6 to 20 times higher than those in S\u00e3o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Mexico City. This might lead many to the conclusion that Latin American cities should not care about climate change, especially when they are faced with under-employment, housing backlogs and other more pressing development concerns; when considering the wealthiest nations emit most greenhouse gases it is the high-consumption lifestyles of the wealthy that drive climate change and must, hence, take urgent actions to curb their emissions and avoid catastrophic and irreversible damages. However, there are two sets of reasons here why urban centres in the region must pay attention to this burgeoning global phenomenon: first, our cities are especially vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, and are faced with the health impacts of atmospheric pollution; second, cities can also play a pivotal role in our efforts both to cope with or adapt to heat waves, floods and other climate hazards, and to reduce or mitigate the emissions of greenhouse gasses and other atmospheric pollutants.<\/p>\n<p>The incidence of weather-related disasters in cities has increased more than twofold between 1970 and 2005. These included not only increasingly destructive hurricanes such as Mitch (1998) and Wilma (2005), and two intense episodes of El Ni\u00f1o, which, together with land use changes, resulted in floods, droughts, landslides and other disasters killing people and impacting the population, infrastructure and economic activities of many urban areas.<\/p>\n<p>The disruption of our climate system will add to the risks and stresses that Latin American cities, where 77 per cent of the population is located, are already facing. For example, urban dwellers in Low Elevation Coastal Zones will be exposed to storm flooding and damage, coastal erosion, and increased salinity of aquifers. Urban centres in Northern Chile, the Brazilian North-East and Northern Mexico and other arid and semi-arid regions will face particular problems of water shortages. Many water basins will get less precipitation, which will reduce the availability of fresh water. This will be especially hard for growing cities and large cities that already face serious problems in their fresh water supplies \u2013 e.g. urban centres along the US\/Mexican border. As illustrated by the December 1999 flash floods and landslides in Caracas, which killed nearly 30,000, or the floods resulting from hurricane Stan in 2005 (more than 1,500 deaths), higher than average and more extreme rainfall events associated with climate change will be related to flood hazards, increased landslides and mudflows. A range of health-related risks is expected to arise from climate change. Extreme temperatures will coalesce with air pollution and the heat island effect to create heat and respiratory distress. Water-and vector-borne diseases will result from changes in temperature, precipitation, and\/or humidity. Less direct risks are also expected, such as negatively affected livelihoods, food supplies or access to water and other natural resources.<\/p>\n<p>Adaptive capacity, i.e. the ability of cities, their population and economic activities to reduce climate stresses or cope with their consequences, is as key a determinant of climate impacts as is exposure. Latin American cities have been struggling with \u2013 or even lacking \u2013 many of the determinants of adaptive capacity. During the 1990s, 48 per cent of urban workers were employed in the informal sector, thus lacking access to adequate and stable income sources. In the context of the state reform of the last 25 years, public provision of transport, healthcare, and water and sanitation services was practically abandoned by the state, or \u2018decentralised\u2019 to the private sector and local authorities. All this has negatively affected the key determinants of adaptive capacity such as stable and sufficient incomes, access to water, electricity, food, healthcare, education and other services and infrastructures.<\/p>\n<p>Many cities have no all-weather roads. The proportion of urban dwellers without piped water supplies ranges between 1.2 per cent in Chile and 42 per cent in El Salvador, while the percentage without drains ranges between 13 per cent in Chile and 77 per cent in Paraguay. About 37 per cent of the housing stock in the region is inappropriate to offer protection against disaster and diseases. Many homes are situated on illegally occupied or subdivided land, which inhibits any investment in more resilient buildings. Large sections of the low-income population live on risk-prone areas and dangerous sites \u2013 e.g. floodplains \u2013 because these are the only sites for them to occupy that are within reach of income-earning opportunities. Thus, it is difficult to talk about adapting infrastructure and buildings that are not there. It is more adequate to refer to adaptation deficits and even to the lack of adaptive capacity.<\/p>\n<p>Latin America has a long history of adapting to the impacts of stresses related to climate variability, including extreme weather events. Some are autonomous adaptations that occur without any specific planning. In Costa Rica and Ecuador for instance, communities have improved their housing design with elevated or reinforced concrete strips as foundations, and bamboo walls that are not touching the ground to better cope with floods and droughts. Low-income households in for instance El Salvador invest an average nine per cent of their incomes in risk-reduction actions \u2013 e.g. diversifying their livelihoods, getting assets that could easily be sold if a disaster occurred. The individualistic nature of households\u2019 investments, the lack of representative community organisations through which to design and implement settlement-wide measures, and the lack of support from government agencies limits their effect.<\/p>\n<p>There are good examples of city governments, such as in Manizales in Colombia and Ilo in Peru, that are taking steps together with NGOs, communities and other local actors to promote development, and, in doing so they reduce vulnerability. Governments and involved stakeholders implemented actions to avoid rapidly-growing low-income populations settling on dangerous sites, but also to improve the living standards of the poor and to protect and regenerate fragile ecological areas. They illustrate how pro-development and pro-poor policies can enhance adaptive capacity.<\/p>\n<p>The problem is that most of the policy-driven adaptation practices are disaster responses rather than policies that actively reduce risks and address the factors that make poorer groups vulnerable. The poor quality of infrastructure and the lack of maintenance are key determinants of dams failing, public hospitals and schools and bridges and motorways collapsing as a result of weather-related disasters. Only 150,000 houses out of 16 million (i.e. less than 1 per cent) had disaster insurance coverage in Mexico in 1998. The rate of insurance coverage for the Venezuela floods of 1999 only accounted for 1.4 per cent of total losses. As highlighted by events such as Hurricane Stan that hit Mexico and Guatemala in 2005, individuals bear most of the cost and manage it through the solidarity of family and other networks, if at all. The lack of transparency in public works procurement frequently leads to corruption and poor quality infrastructure and buildings. Many urban governments also have antagonistic relationships with low-income groups. Decentralisation should have helped address these issues. However, in many cases decentralisation of responsibilities to urban authorities has not been accompanied by increased revenues or revenue-raising capacity. In most cases, the reform of the state during the 1990s weakened many of the mechanisms that support adaptive capacity as the state withdrew itself from public transport, health care and public works.<br \/> Although Latin American cities are not big emitters, they need to pay attention to actions aimed at reducing their emissions. First, wealthy cities such as Tokyo and Barcelona have pretty low levels of emissions per capita. Latin American cities need to address some of the factors that are jeopardising cities\u2019 capacity to promote sustainable patterns of urbanisation, namely: urban sprawl, associated increased commuting distance and increasing use of low-capacity modes of transport.<\/p>\n<p>Buenos Aires, Santiago and Mexico City for instance, experienced during the last two decades a region-based or polycentric urban expansion of first and second-order urban localities sprawling along major motorways and functionally linked to the main city. This pathway of urbanisation is associated to relevant consequences for both GHG and other atmospheric emissions. As illustrated by Mexico City, passengers\u2019 commuting distance and travel times increased from 3.5 km\/h and 16.8 km\/h by bus in 1987 to 5.6 km and 16.7 km\/h in 2000. The same may be the case with freight transport. More sprawled patterns of urban growth are related to variations in car use, petrol consumption, and by this, to more emissions.<\/p>\n<p>Second, there are very large differentials within urban centres. Equity and affluence in other words are other key dimensions of the carbon footprints by Latin American cities. The transport sector of Mexico City, which accounts for the highest share (34.7 per cent) of CO2 equivalent emissions, can also illustrate the weight of equity. Private cars only contribute 16 per cent of the city\u2019s daily journeys segments. Still, they account for 40.8 per cent of CO2 equivalent emissions, while public transport accounts for 82 per cent of those journey segments, yet emits 25.9 per cent of CO2 equivalent emissions. Therefore, a key determinant of greenhouse gas and other atmospheric emissions is the consumption patterns of middle- and high-income sectors together with the production systems that benefit from that consumption.<\/p>\n<p>Third, policy making in Mexico City and other Latin American cities involved in the International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives (ICLEI) campaign and other climate initiatives illustrates the role that urban authorities can play in reducing emissions. They show that policies addressing other problems, such as air pollution and energy, can often be adapted at low or no cost to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and simultaneously improve the health of the population. The burning of fossil fuels is linked to climate change, energy security and air pollution. Thus reductions in the amount of fuel combusted will result in lower greenhouse gas emissions, lower energy costs and lower health and environmental impacts from reduced emissions of air pollutants and their precursors. However, attention needs to be given not only to the synergies, but also to the conflicts between these three policy domains. For instance, standards to improve the fuel efficiency of vehicles can reduce both local pollution and CO2 emissions per vehicle-km. Yet, they can result in increased emissions if vehicles\u2019 travel distances increase, or drivers switch to vehicles with larger engines.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_60\" style=\"width: 406px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-60\" title=\"07_SA08Ref_Lankaoe2\" src=\"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/08\/07_SA08Ref_Lankaoe2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"396\" height=\"324\" \/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Carbon Emissions Per Capita<\/p><\/div>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_61\" style=\"width: 406px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-61\" title=\"07_SA08Ref_Lankaoe3\" src=\"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/08\/07_SA08Ref_Lankaoe3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"396\" height=\"305\" \/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Air Pollution (PM10)<\/p><\/div>\n<p>To summarise, there are many reasons why Latin American cities need to address their many linkages with climate change: they concentrate industries, transport, households and many of the emitters of greenhouse gases and other atmospheric pollutants. They are affected by hurricanes, storms, water shortages and other hazards that climate change is expected to aggravate. Furthermore, without climate change they already face adaptation deficits. Therefore, actions need to be taken to address those and, by doing so, to enhance the adaptive capacity of urban populations, economic activities and infrastructures. Latin American cities are sources of initiatives, policies and actions aimed at reducing or mitigating emissions and coping with or adapting to climate change. However, those measures are still tiny, ineffective and not targeting climate change.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":"http:\/\/v0.urban-age.net\/0_downloads\/archive\/_SA\/07_NewsPaper_Essay_Lankao.pdf","article_publishing_date":"December 2008","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"7","name":"Patricia Romero","created":"2011-08-30 11:54:34","modified":"2011-08-30 12:54:34","slug":"patricia-romero","family_name":"Lankao","title":null,"email_address":null,"photo_legacy":null,"profile_text":"","organization":"","role":"","additional_affiliations":null,"qualifications":null,"staff_pages_blurb":null,"office_location":null,"display_after":null,"display_until":null,"extended_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb_lang2":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation_lang2":null,"phone_number":null}],"attachments":false,"gallery":{"slug":false,"extra_classes":"","slides":[]}},{"request_language":"","current_page_uri":"\/media\/search-dev.json","lang2_slug":false,"lang2_name":false,"parent_publication_id":19,"featured_image_uri":"","article_title":"The Challenges of Being Open","permalink":"the-challenges-of-being-open","article_subtitle":"Density, Health and Well-being","article_abstract":"","article_summary":"","article_text":"<p>Singapore is an interesting case of a city that is at a stage of planned population increase, driven by immigration rather than by Singaporeans (whose birth rate has been steadily declining). Thus the rising population and higher density is accompanied by increased social diversity: over the past 30 years, Singapore\u2019s foreign born population has increased from five per cent in 1980 to about 22.8 per cent in 2010. Coupled with an increased mobility, shaped by the new economy of services, tourism and travel and the growing foreign born population, today Singapore faces the challenge of managing the health risks associated with high-density living, increased mobility, a more sedentary lifestyle, and the stresses associated with urban living.<\/p>\n<p>Although modern Singapore has worked to manage most of the negative impacts of high-density living, such as widening inequalities, environmental degradation and social disruption, the impact on health has not been easily mitigated. The degree of interaction increases in highly dense communities, assisting in the rate of spread of infectious diseases. The 2009 H1N1 influenza virus is a case in point. In the three months following its identification in Mexico in late April 2009, it became a global pandemic affecting practically every country in the world. In Singapore, researchers tracked the transmission of the virus by looking for antibodies, a type of immune response to infection. They found a rate of infection in the general population of 13 per cent, and identified the use of public transport as a risk factor for infection. Amongst military conscripts, the infection rate was double that of the general population. Both findings suggest that higher degrees of social contact and interation were important in facilitating the spread of the H1N1 virus.<\/p>\n<p>Singapore\u2019s &#8216;openness&#8217; can have its drawbacks in relation to infectious disease. The two major epidemics of recent years in Singapore \u2013 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and H1N1 &#8211; were both imported. Singapore\u2019s relative openness to travel and the movement of people also means that even &#8216;traditional&#8217; infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis, can be a risk. Despite control efforts, the rate of tuberculosis continues to be relatively high in Singapore, due in part to the high-population density in the city and its openness to the global movement of people.<\/p>\n<p>While it is easy to appreciate the impact of urbanisation and high-density living on highly contagious infectious diseases, the impact on chronic disease is not as obvious and more likely to be missed. Nevertheless, urban environments can play significant roles in chronic disease development. Overweight and obesity are &#8216;conditions of modernity&#8217; that are strongly linked to the development of medical diseases such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension and some types of cancer. Since the late 1980s, many Western countries have reported a growing epidemic of obesity in their countries. Studies in India and China and other developing countries around the world have also illustrated how obesity, diabetes and hypertension seem to increase in tandem with rapid urbanisation and modernisation. Recent research has suggested the concept of &#8216;obesogenic environments&#8217; as a risk factor for this \u2018modern plague\u2019. This approach recognises the importance of environmental factors in the causation of obesity and its related medical problems, and specifically identifies some urban factors as risks. Some of these factors are related to high-density living, including the modern built environment, with its focus on convenience and minimising physical activity (for example, in the use of lifts and escalators), the urban transport network, which aims to deliver convenient and efficient mechanised transport to the masses, and the absence, in some dense cities, of parks and sports or other recreational facilities that can promote physical activity. The health impacts of high density living need to be taken into account by urban planners and incorporated into their designs so that adverse effects can be mitigated or ameliorated.\u00a0 \u00a0<\/p>\n<p>Singapore\u2019s health management issues today, which stem from affluence, increased mobility and diverse points of contact, are in dramatic contrast to its past, where the problems were created by poverty, congestion and poor hygiene conditions. Developed in 1819 as a port city under the British, the openness of Singapore created challenges and conflicts for urban planning and management. The dynamic flow of goods and commodities in and out of the city was paralleled with the flow of migrants in search of a better life. The development of the port occurred closely alongside the growing congestion of the city, as infrastructure struggled to keep pace and a confined territory restricted the availability of land for expansion.<\/p>\n<p>Two fairly detailed surveys by the Department of Social Welfare in 1947 and 1954 provided an idea of the extent of congestion in Singapore\u2019s central areas. This extract gives a sense of the cramped sleeping arrangements: &#8216;bunks in passage ways, \u2026 tiered bed\u2011lofts \u00a0\u2026people sleeping under or over staircases \u2026 in five\u2011foot [passage]ways, kitchens and backyards, and other places used for sleeping without enclosures or partitions&#8217;. In 1947, the percentage of households using such spaces was 21 per cent in ward one (the harbour area stretching to west Chinatown), 16 per cent in ward two (the rest of Chinatown, including the business district, extending east to Middle Road) and 26 per cent in ward three (comprising areas east of Middle Road, bounded by Serangoon Road and the Kallang River). By 1954, when the second survey was done, the figures had increased to 38 per cent in wards one and two, and had dropped slightly to 25 per cent in ward three. These conditions are described in more detail in Barrington Kaye&#8217;s <em>Upper Nanking Street, <\/em>arguably the first urban sociology study attempted in Singapore<em>. <\/em>Upper Nanking Street was one of the most congested neighbourhoods in \u00a0Singapore in the 1950s, in the heart of Chinatown. Kaye\u2019s case interviews in particular provide an enduring account of the hardships faced as residents coped with cramped, spartan and often insanitary living conditions, unemployment and ill-health.<\/p>\n<p>The 1960s and 70s were a time of social and physical transformation in Singapore. The city-state had gained its independence, and had a government which was elected and therefore more responsive to the population. The new government put in place a more effective set of infrastructures, in order to secure the political legitimacy to govern. This period saw, amongst a number of major national projects, the development of a comprehensive public housing system and plans to decentralise the population, in response to Singapore\u2019s increasingly congested and unsanitary conditions.. At the time, the central area described by Barrington Kaye (1,700 acres of land around the Singapore River) housed a population density of about 247,000 persons per square kilometre (640,000 persons per square mile), making it one of the world\u2019s most congested slums.<\/p>\n<p>Starting with the 1958 Master Plan, efforts were made to decentralise the population. This trend continued with subsequent plans, such as the 1971 Ring Concept Plan, based on a ring of development around the water catchment area and linear development along the southern coast. This plan was formulated to provide for a future population of four million (a projection which has been revised continually upwards). High-density residential developments follow the water catchment area and the southern coast and are served by an island-wide system of expressways and a mass rapid transit system.<\/p>\n<p>The public housing development programme took the form of new town development, based on high-rise public housing with supporting amenities such as schools, markets, polyclinics, and recreational and sports facilities. Community centres located in housing estates enhanced the integration of residents from different ethnic groups. The policy of encouraging married children to stay close to their parents was also significant. Thus the integrated development of the new towns both met the daily needs of households and facilitated community life.<\/p>\n<p>The early new towns, such as Toa Payoh and Queenstown, adopted a plot ratio of about 2.8 (i.e. the floor area of the building allowed was 2.8 times the area of land). As the population increased further, taller apartment blocks of up to 30 storeys were built and building densities began to creep upwards, reaching a plot ration of 3.5. More recently, it is not uncommon to have plot ratios above four, while at Duxton, public housing has been built to 50 storeys and a plot ratio of nine.<\/p>\n<p>High residential and buildings densities are needed to accommodate Singapore\u2019s growing population and its expanding economy, ensuring hygienic conditions and decent living spaces for its residents, as well as social and recreational facilities. Such densities, combined with the increased mobility and openness that is typical of today\u2019s global cities, present new challenges to health and well-being in Singapore. As in the 1960s, when Singapore\u2019s new government initiated a major infrastructural development project in response to poor health and living conditions in its central areas, once again there is a need to integrate the approach to urban planning and management with today\u2019s health challenges: emerging and re-emerging infectious disease and chronic disease.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/11\/2011_chw_5020_Chia-Heng-Ho.pdf","article_publishing_date":"November 2011","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"120","name":"Kee Seng","created":"2011-11-04 11:33:54","modified":"2011-12-14 21:44:10","slug":null,"family_name":"Chia","title":null,"email_address":null,"photo_legacy":null,"profile_text":null,"organization":null,"role":null,"additional_affiliations":null,"qualifications":null,"staff_pages_blurb":null,"office_location":null,"display_after":null,"display_until":null,"extended_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb_lang2":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation_lang2":null,"phone_number":null},{"id":"121","name":"C.

Depending on how you count, Istanbul has been the capital city of three, or perhaps four,  empires.\">Istanbul is a city as beautiful as Venice or San Francisco, and, once you are away from the water, as brutal and ugly as any metropolis undergoing the trauma of warp speed urbanisation. It is a place in which to sit under the shade of ancient pines and palm trees for a leisurely afternoon watching sun on water, looking out over the Bosporus. But also, in some parts, to tread very carefully. Istanbul has as many layers of history beneath the foundations of its buildings as any city in Europe. In 2010, it will become the European Cultural Capital. Depending on how you count, Istanbul has been the capital city of three, or perhaps four, empires. It is still shaped by the surviving fragments of Greek, Roman, Byzantine, Venetian and Ottoman civilisations. It has Orthodox Christian churches, Sunni mosques, and Sephardic synagogues. It has vast classical cisterns, ring upon ring of ancient fortifications, souks and palaces. It also has desolate concrete suburbs of extraordinary bleakness, urban terrorism, and a rootless, dispossessed underclass struggling to come to terms with city life.<\/p>\n<p>It is the largest city in a state that emerged in 1923 from the chaos of World War I and the Versailles treaty, and the vision of modern Turkey\u2019s founder, Kemal Ataturk, who, though he was born in what is now Salonika, and so unmistakably a European, moved his capital to Ankara, a city created almost from nothing. For the first few decades of modern Turkey\u2019s existence, the state devoted most of its resources to the new capital and its infrastructure. For a while it looked as if Ankara and Istanbul might become twin poles: one a European gate, the other a counterbalance in the heartland of Anatolia. As Turkey\u2019s urbanisation started to accelerate in the 1950s, the balance shifted overwhelmingly towards Istanbul. The rural poor poured into the big city and what used to be considered a cosmopolitan enclave, a demonstration of Turkey\u2019s tolerance of other ethnic groups and faiths, has also become the heartland of its most conservative constituency. It is a city in which 3,500 dispossessed gypsies, descendants of a community that has lived in the Sulukule district in the shadow of the Byzantine city walls for centuries, are being systematically being moved out of sight and out of mind in an operation that recalls Robert Moses\u2019 determination to drive federally funded highways through the black and Puerto Rican neighbourhoods of New York City.<\/p>\n<p>Istanbul is the largest and most febrile urban centre in a country with an army committed to secularism, which, in some extreme cases, shades away from Ataturk\u2019s ideals towards authoritarianism. If the generals miscalculate, it has the potential for an insurgency that could make Turkey a kind of Algeria and Istanbul its Algiers. But Istanbul is also what is driving Turkey, toward Brazil, Russia, India and China, the new economic powerhouses. The collapse of the Soviet Union made Turkey in general, and Istanbul in particular, a vital new centre for services and expertise profiting from a rapid growth in the energy-rich former Soviet republics. It is a phenomenon which is reflected in the array of carriers at Istanbul\u2019s greatly enlarged airport, from Uzbekistan Airways, and Dniproavia, Tajikistan Airlines, Air Astana, Donbassaero and Tatarstan Airlines, their hulls painted in gaudy colours, more like busses than Boeings.<\/p>\n<p>It is also visible in the stream of ships that clogs the Bosporus day and night, a continuous double file of tankers and freighters flows past the minarets and the suspension bridges that define the city. Istanbul is the base for the architects, the construction companies, the advertising agencies, and the banks that are reshaping Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan, and the Ukraine and even Russia. It has banks and television stations; it has manufacturers that are shooting rapidly up the value chain from generic products to designer label kitchen sinks.<\/p>\n<p data-pullquote=\"Istanbul is Turkey\u2019s passport into the European Union. It sees itself as part of a group of cities on an axis running from Dubai to St. Petersburg.\">Istanbul is Turkey\u2019s passport into the European Union. It sees itself as part of a group of cities on an axis running from Dubai to St. Petersburg. If London is Europe\u2019s first global city, Istanbul sees itself as its second. It\u2019s a city whose influence is shaped by both culture and commerce. Istanbul has a thriving approach to contemporary art, although surprisingly perhaps, given the close personal interest that Ataturk himself took in architectural issues, importing Austrians to plan Ankara, it has not as yet developed a distinctive architectural culture of its own in the way that Mexico or Australia have. Its geographic size and population mean that Istanbul has a strong claim to being regarded as the largest city in Europe, even if it partly lies in Asia, where a third of its citizens now live. In the European suburb of Levent, one of Istanbul\u2019s main business districts where banks cluster, you can find facsimiles of smart London Chinese restaurants and mega shopping centres. But Istanbul is also a place with settlements within its limits, in which Kurdish migrants from rural Anatolia tend flocks of sheep under the gaze of prefabricated concrete apartment blocks.<\/p>\n<p>It is a city like no other and yet it is a city that has things in common with many other cities, even if it does not always recognise it. While Cairo\u2019s population has doubled, Istanbul\u2019s population, like Lagos, has quadrupled since 1980. It straddles two continents, in a way that is very different from, but inevitably also reminiscent of, the twin cities of El Paso and Ciudad Juarez straddling the Rio Grande, blurring Mexico with the United States.<\/p>\n<p>Istanbul is home to nearly 13 million people, governed in a recently created unitary jurisdiction, which saw the city\u2019s land area nearly tripled from approximately 1,800 km2 to 5,300 km2. Even now, it still pulls in another 1.5 million workers every day, swelling its peak time population to 15 million. The city administration is attempting to limit its population to 16 million, fearing that if it is allowed to spread unchecked it will reach an impossible 25 million, in a country that has currently 71 million people. But this is really in the hands of the national government, rather than the city, given that the GDP of the poorest regions in Turkey is just 20 per cent of that of the richest areas of the country. With such an imbalance, it is no wonder that Istanbul has become a magnet for the rural poor. Turkey\u2019s internal migration has had the effect of making the inequalities of Istanbul grow more acute, rather than less, even as it has prospered over the last decades. And it is not the master of its own fate. There is the TOKI state housing programme, run by the Prime Minister.<\/p>\n<p>Very few cities have such a compartmentalised geography. The vast majority of Istanbul\u2019s citizens never make the crossing from one continent to the other. But the 10 per cent who do cross from one half of the city to the other every day amount to a still huge total of 1.2 million. And to accommodate them, there is a plan to build a third bridge across the straits. However, it is feared by some that this will destroy the reservoirs that feed the city. Ask civic leaders if there is an environmental problem for Istanbul. The first thing that they talk about is August 17, 1999, when a serious earthquake hit the city, causing 20,000 deaths. Natural resources, population growth, and civil equity barely figure.<\/p>\n<p>But there are ambitious plans to create linear sub centres, both on the east and the west sides of the city, allowing the two sections to function better. The one on the Asian side of the city, at Kartal, is being shaped in its early stages by a dynamic masterplan prepared by Zaha Hadid. Among such privately financed developments, Istanbul has been investing heavily in its infrastructure. A metro system is gradually taking shape, the trams are being revitalised. There is a new rail tunnel under the Bosporus which will allow the realisation of the ancient goal of one of Europe\u2019s empires, to create a direct rail link from Berlin to Baghdad.<\/p>\n<p>In a world in which an accommodation between competing power blocks is essential for both cultural and political reasons, Istanbul is a key bridge between them. It is a city with more than enough of the usual urban problems, but that also the energy and the resources to stand a chance of addressing them. It\u2019s in nobody\u2019s interest that they should fail.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-719\" title=\"01_01\" src=\"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/11\/01_01.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"589\" height=\"441\" \/><\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":"http:\/\/v0.urban-age.net\/publications\/newspapers\/istanbul\/articles\/01_DeyanSudjic\/en_GB\/01_DeyanSudjic_en.pdf","article_publishing_date":"November 2009","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"5","name":"Fabio","created":"2011-08-30 11:01:22","modified":"2011-08-30 14:47:57","slug":"fabio","family_name":"Casiroli","title":null,"email_address":null,"photo_legacy":null,"profile_text":"<p>Fabio Casiroli is a visiting professor at DPA Milan Polytechnic.

Constrained from expanding spatially by the shortage of buildable land, the Hong Kong Government\u2019s longstanding land policy has been to build up rather than out, thereby facilitating the housing of some seven million people, a world-class transport and logistics hub and a top-tier financial centre in just 1,068 square kilometres (412 square miles). All of this contributes to the exciting, bustling and cosmopolitan atmosphere that defines Hong Kong as one of the world\u2019s truly iconic cities. Yet, this excitement, and the efficiencies bred by proximity, carry a substantial price tag.<\/p>\n<p>Hong Kong residents must cope with some of the highest population densities on the planet in an environment that is characterised by ranks of high-rise office and residential buildings, extremely limited urban open space, a measurable urban heat island effect and dangerously high concentrations of roadside pollution that fail to disperse from poorly ventilated street canyons. It is for good reason that the public policy think tank Civic Exchange characterised Hong Kong\u2019s urban livability (with apologies to Thomas Friedman) as \u2018Hot, Stacked and Crowded\u2019, in a report published in April 2010.<\/p>\n<p>The impacts on public health are substantial. The best researched and best understood of these is air pollution, for which Hong Kong is sadly developing a growing international notoriety. Overseas concerns about Hong Kong\u2019s air quality range from warnings against travel by the Australian Government in 2009, to active promotion by Singapore of its clean and healthy living environment in its eternal battle to attract expatriate talent and investment away from Hong Kong \u2013 a trend identified in report on the future of Asian Financial Centres by the City of London.<\/p>\n<p>All of this begs the question: how bad is it really? Where Hong Kong scores well is that air pollution both from the city and the surrounding Pearl River Delta (PRD) region is actively monitored, and the public has access to that data. The Environmental Protection Department publishes an Air Pollution Index, which gives a number for the aggregated levels of four major pollutants \u2013 sulphur dioxide (SO<sub>2<\/sub>), nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter and ozone. However, since high levels of NOx generally coincide with lower levels of ozone, thereby effectively \u2018cancelling each other out\u2019 and lowering the readings shown by the Index, the real threat to health from air pollution is systematically understated.<\/p>\n<p>An alternative source of information is the Hedley Environmental Index (HEI) \u2013 a website developed by the University of Hong Kong\u2019s School of Public Health and launched in December 2008. It provides the public with real-time information on the measured concentrations of the four pollutants listed above, which creates a much more accurate picture.<\/p>\n<p>The HEI goes a step further by providing the public with real-time information on the estimated impacts on public health by the current levels of air pollution. By calculating the estimated numbers of premature deaths, hospital bed days and doctor visits, using a scientifically robust, peer-reviewed methodology, it shows that air pollution has cost US$261 million (HK$2.03 billion), and contributed to 891 deaths, 67,890 hospital bed-days and some 6.6 million doctor visits in the last 12 months alone.<\/p>\n<p>One of the key features of the HEI is to highlight the difference in emissions from different sources. Hong Kong\u2019s ambient air quality (a combination of emissions from all Hong Kong sources, plus the pollution carried across the border into Hong Kong from the highly industrialised PRD region is measured by general monitoring stations located some 20 metres (65 feet) above the ground. Roadside air quality is monitored at three stations situated much closer to ground level in three of Hong Kong\u2019s most developed and congested districts \u2013 the shopping meccas of Mong Kok and Causeway Bay and Central. The figures show that roadside pollution (of which NOx is a major component) is consistently and substantially higher than the levels of ambient pollution.<\/p>\n<p>Due to its high levels and ubiquity roadside air pollution poses a major component of the threat to public health. NOx, which has been linked to reduced lung development in children and underweight births, is just one element. Particulate matter, especially diesel fumes, is responsible for a number of allergies and can also cause inflammation of major organs and blood vessels, leading to strokes, heart attacks and other acute conditions. More widespread complaints caused by Hong Kong\u2019s toxic cocktail include irritation of the eyes and nose, coughing, shortness of breath and an increase in, and more intense, asthma attacks.<\/p>\n<p>These impacts are experiences disproportionately by the poor and by women. The poor tend to live in the most congested districts and fill the ranks of the professionally exposed, for example drivers, street-level stallholders and shop workers, while women are subject to all the same health threats as men, but must often shoulder a greater burden as the primary care giver, taking time off work to accompany an ailing grandparent to hospital or sit up through the night with a coughing child.<\/p>\n<p>So, to rephrase the initial question: why is roadside pollution in Hong Kong still so bad, when it is known to be so harmful?<\/p>\n<p>There are two major reasons. The first is that Hong Kong\u2019s vehicle fleet includes large numbers of diesel-powered buses and trucks, plus large fleets of LPG (liquefied petroleum gas)-powered taxis and minibuses. Many of these are ageing, and in the absence of effective regulations governing inspection and maintenance (Hong Kong\u2019s Air Pollution Control Ordinance only control smoky vehicles, not those generating invisible but equally harmful toxic pollutants such as NOx), toxic emissions from these fleets are substantial and poorly controlled.<\/p>\n<p>And herein lies a big part of the conundrum. Hong Kong is justly famed for the efficiency of its public transport, which is based partly on the high population densities that make public transport economically viable. However, the public transport franchises under which the buses and taxis operate are designed to ensure that the service provided is cheap, plentiful and roadworthy \u2013 but not necessarily environmentally friendly.<\/p>\n<p>As public concerns about air pollution have risen so has pressure to rein in emissions from these sources. But newer, cleaner vehicles and retrofitting with catalytic converters will all cost money. Any investment must be recuperated through higher fares, and when such a large proportion of the population depends on public transport for its mobility, increases are politically difficult to secure.<\/p>\n<p>The second reason is that the high population densities are brought about by the city\u2019s vertical approach to property development. While public transport benefits from the congregations of potential passengers, the same high-rise buildings ironically form the walls of the street canyons that make it so much more difficult for street-level concentrations of pollutants to disperse. This situation is exacerbated by the low provision of public open space and the consistently excessive height and width of buildings designed to take up every square foot of available land in order to maximise the economic returns.<\/p>\n<p>Research by Hong Kong University of Science and Technology has shown that concentrations of roadside pollutants vary substantially between well- and poorly ventilated areas. The research also showed that differing levels of congestion and the overall number of vehicles also contributed to concentrations of pollutants, with the worst areas being those that combined high congestion and poor ventilation \u2013 total numbers of vehicles was a less significant factor.<\/p>\n<p>As concern about air pollution has escalated so has public frustration about the lack of effective control measures. But air quality is now so poor that developers of new infrastructure projects are experiencing difficulties in meeting the standards required by Hong Kong\u2019s environmental impact assessment (EIA) process. Two major projects \u2013 the Hong Kong Zhuhai Macau Bridge, which is intended to connect Hong Kong with the western PRD, and the plans for adding a third runway to the airport, are providing an important opportunity for a new conversation about how to define the limits of sustainable development.<\/p>\n<p>The EIA for the Bridge was challenged in a judicial review raised by a resident living close to the airport, over concerns about the impact of emissions from tens of thousands of additional vehicles on air quality and public health. The court found in favour of the applicant, throwing out the government\u2019s approval of the EIA on the grounds that air quality had not been properly assessed.<\/p>\n<p>With aviation growing rapidly in the PRD the Airport Authority (AA) has begun to discuss the need for adding a third runway to the airport. A third runway would not only attract more aircraft, but also greatly increase the volume of traffic, bringing additional passengers, cargo and associated services to the airport. All of these will generate more emissions, particularly NOx, and the preliminary report from the AA\u2019s environmental consultant notes that the new runway would only be able to operate at 40 per cent capacity if air quality standards are to be met.<\/p>\n<p>Thus there is a growing understanding that Hong Kong\u2019s air quality is now directly threatening not only the health of its citizens but also the economic development of the city. The numbers involved are substantial. The AA has estimated that a third runway will cost US$17 billion (HK$132 billion) to build and generate economic benefits of up to US$116 billion (HK$900 billion). Businesses ranging from airlines to hoteliers, from engineers to banks, and even the Government itself, have a strong vested interest in seeing this project approved. The first signs are emerging that this will galvanise both polluters and regulators to act swiftly to find ways to reduce pollution to the point that an EIA for the third runway can be approved.<\/p>\n<p>Reducing NOx from road transport will be a major part of any successful control strategy. While the aim will be to reduce emissions in the immediate vicinity of the airport, cleaner vehicles servicing the airport area will also run clean elsewhere in the city, thereby helping to bring down the overall aggregate of pollutants from the fleet.<\/p>\n<p>Reducing emissions is important because it is much easier to retire or properly maintain a fleet of buses than to knock down buildings in the densest areas for the sake of improved ventilation of overbuilt urban areas. But the very fact that such solutions are being discussed at all is an interesting indicator of the Hong Kong public\u2019s growing desire to follow the decades of prioritising economic development over the environment with a rebalancing in favour of improving the public\u2019s health and quality of life.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/11\/2011_chw_3030_Loh-Kilburn.pdf","article_publishing_date":"November 2011","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"108","name":"Mike","created":"2011-11-04 10:01:19","modified":"2011-11-04 10:01:19","slug":null,"family_name":"Kilburn","title":null,"email_address":null,"photo_legacy":null,"profile_text":null,"organization":null,"role":null,"additional_affiliations":null,"qualifications":null,"staff_pages_blurb":null,"office_location":null,"display_after":null,"display_until":null,"extended_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb_lang2":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation_lang2":null,"phone_number":null},{"id":"107","name":"Christine K.

Throughout the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, there have been significant improvements in indicators of health and life expectancy among urban populations.<br \/> Why then a concern about urban health inequities? In all countries, rich and poor, there is an unequal social distribution of health both within countries (the urban-rural divide) and within cities (the social gradient). Even though health is, on average, better in urban than in rural areas, this masks urban disadvantage, where health can be as bad as or worse than in rural areas. A 2007 analysis of child health outcomes in 47 developing countries found that the risk of stunting and mortality was on average 1.4 times higher in urban than rural areas while, in nine of the 47 countries, urban children from lower socioeconomic households had higher rates of mortality. In sub-Saharan African cities, children living in informal settlements are more likely to die from entirely preventable respiratory and waterborne illnesses than those living in rural areas. In Kenya, for example, not only are there marked inequities in under-five mortality rates within the city of Nairobi, but the rate is far worse in Nairobi\u2019s slums and informal settlements than in Kenya as a whole and its rural areas.<\/p>\n<p>Urbanisation itself is re-shaping population health problems, particularly among the urban poor, towards non-communicable diseases and injuries. As the degree of urbanisation and national income increases, so too does the prevalence of diabetes, heart disease, obesity, mental health problems, alcohol and drug abuse and violence. In low- and middle-income countries the prevalence of hypertension is increasing, with rates being higher in urban than in rural settings. Obesity has become increasingly more prevalent among socially disadvantaged groups and often sits cheek-by-jowl with underweight among poor populations in many cities throughout the world.<br \/> Within poor countries, poor people suffer a higher burden of morbidity and mortality from traffic injuries. In rich countries, children from poor socioeconomic classes suffer more injuries and deaths from road crashes than their counterparts from high-income groups. Crime and violence are more pronounced in urban areas, especially in slums, than in rural settings. Homicide rates are high and still growing in some cities, and robbery poses a major problem in many urban centres, not least because it contributes to general feelings of fear and insecurity.<\/p>\n<h3>The social and environmental determinants of urban health inequities<\/h3>\n<p>The Global Research Network on Urban Health Equity (GRNUHE) followed a \u2018social determinants\u2019 approach to health, exemplified by the World Health Organization\u2019s Commission on Social Determinants of Health, headed by Professor Sir Michael Marmot. This approach notes that health is a result not only of biology but also of the interconnected material, psychosocial and political conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work and age. Following a social determinants approach has implications for the policies and programmes aimed to reduce these inequities. Under this approach, urban health equity depends vitally on pursuing processes of political empowerment so that individuals and groups can better represent their needs and interests and, in so doing, can challenge and change the unfair distribution of material and psychosocial resources.<br \/> In urban terms, the social determinants approach suggests that improving living conditions in such areas as income, housing, transport, employment, education, social support and health services is central to improving the health of urban populations. In reality, however, the restructuring of cities by the global marketplace, while conferring benefit for some, has led to rapid and often unplanned urbanisation, outpacing the ability of governments to build essential infrastructure and services and provide basic needs for living. While urban areas pose a major opportunity to improve health equity, to date current urban restructuring has contributed to a growing gap between the living conditions of rich and poor in cities.<br \/> While city populations have tended to become wealthier than their rural counterparts, they have become increasingly unequal. For the majority of developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America, inequalities in urban areas generally exceed the inequalities in rural areas (Figure 2). These relative inequalities in social matters affect the social distribution of health outcomes. Work by Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett, The Spirit Level: Why Equality is Better for Everyone (2009), although based on data from high-income countries and not at the city level, demonstrates a marked correlation between income inequality and health inequities within nations.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to the social causes of urban health inequities is global environmental change. There is now widespread recognition that the disruption and depletion of natural environmental systems, including climate change, has profound implications for the health of people globally. These environmental disruptions encompass climate and atmospheric change, pollution and ecotoxicity, depletion of resources and loss of habitats, species and bidoversity. The combination of these changes is already affecting the health of the population in some parts of the world and, as these trends continue, the number of people affected will grow.<\/p>\n<h3>A \u2018social and environmental determinants\u2019 model of urban health equity<\/h3>\n<p>During 2009 and 2010, GRNUHE, which was financially supported by the Rockefeller Foundation, reviewed the evidence on what could be done to address the social determinants of material, psychosocial and political empowerment of urban populations, especially in low- and middle-income countries, and thereby improve health of the urban poor and the socio-economic gradient in urban health. They developed a model that focused on the interplay between the urban physical form, its social conditions and infrastructure, the added pressure of climate change and the role of governance to determine maximum and equitable health benefits from urbanisation.<\/p>\n<p>They found that there is a reciprocal relationship between urban social conditions and the built environment. For example, poorly planned cities and suburbs coupled with inefficient public transit and road systems result in long and expensive commutes for low-income workers. Long commutes can fray family and community ties, reduce the opportunity for social gatherings or leisure and recreation, create conditions that make crime and violence (and the fear that accompanies them) more likely or reduce access to basic amenities and services. They also note that urban planning can either contribute to or help mitigate climate change, depending upon how energy-efficient and carbon-intensive the city\u2019s built form and transportation systems are. The nature of the physical environment can also make it easier or more difficult for people and communities to adapt to climate change. Similarly, the effects of climate change and other forms of environmental degradation can exacerbate health inequities that are rooted in social and economic conditions, because people who are more socially disadvantaged are more likely to live in hazardous areas and have less access to adaptive technologies such as air conditioning, for example.<br \/> When these aspects of urban life \u2013 the natural and built environments and social and economic conditions \u2013 are well integrated, the product is both improved health and greater health equity and, even more broadly, higher and more equitable levels of human development. This is to the benefit of urban citizens, their communities, local businesses and large employers, the city and indeed the nation as a whole.<br \/> This is a simple message, but one not yet established in cities around the world. A social and environmental determinants approach implies that much of the policy and practice that affects urban health equity lies outside the health sector. In addition to health ministers, national and city ministers for planning, housing, transportation and the environment have a crucial role to play. Effectively communicating the potential for all sectors to impact on urban health and health equity is crucial in order to incorporate health impacts into urban governance.<br \/> All three of the interacting aspects of urban life in the centre of our model are, in turn, nested within the broader concept of urban governance. \u2018Good\u2019 \u2013 or, in our case, \u2018healthy\u2019 \u2013 urban governance is concerned with the equitable distribution of power and resources, and with ensuring an appropriate balance among the competing demands of the various stakeholders in the city for the health of all. This requires a form of governance that engages and empowers the citizenry, especially the most disadvantaged and least powerful people and communities. As environmental sustainability is becoming embedded in national and city governance, so too must health if we are to reduce urban health inequity. That urban health inequities and inequities in social and environmental determinants exist and appear to be widening, particularly in cities in low- and middle-income countries, suggests that there remains much to be done to secure greater health benefits from the opportunities of urbanisation around the world.<\/p>\n<h3>Acknowledgements<\/h3>\n<p>This work was made possible through funding provided by the Rockefeller Foundation and undertaken as a contribution to the Global Research Network on Urban Health Equity.

Atmospheric greenhouse gas levels have already reached the equivalent of around 430ppm (parts per million) of carbon dioxide (CO2 equivalent, CO2e), compared with 280ppm before the industrial revolution. Human activities are pushing the accumulated stock of gases higher, by 2\u20133 ppm every year.<\/p>\n<p>Our work suggests that it is possible to use hard-headed economic analysis to identify goals for global efforts to limit the ultimate level of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere \u2013 the evidence points to a range of 450\u2013550ppm CO2e. This is achievable, economically feasible, and will significantly reduce the risk of extreme temperature changes. To reach the upper end of the change, the world will have to reduce the annual flow of emissions by at least 25 per cent from today\u2019s levels by 2050, cutting emissions until they eventually fall to a level at least 80 per cent lower than now. It would be much safer to go for the middle of the range, which would require a cut in the annual flow of around 50 per cent by 2050, the target agreed at the G8 summit in Heiligendamm in June this year.<\/p>\n<p>Three elements of policy are required for an effective global response. The first is carbon pricing, through tax, trading or regulation, so that people factor the full costs of their actions into their decisions. We must harness the power of markets. Price signals \u2013 whether generated by taxes, regulation, or emissions-trading schemes like those pioneered in the USA \u2013 can drive a myriad of innovations in technology. Using markets recruits every entrepreneur to help tackle the global challenge.<\/p>\n<p>The second policy element is to support innovation and deployment of low-carbon technologies. The world needs to overhaul how it produces its energy. Yet the power sector in OECD countries spent only all of 0.33 per cent on research and development, compared with 2.65 per cent for the manufacturing sector as a whole. The United States showed the way when oil displaced coal and then with electrification. It can do so again, with bio-fuels, carbon capture and storage, and other vital technologies.<\/p>\n<p>The third element is the removal of barriers to energy efficiency and measures to inform, educate and persuade. As people\u2019s understanding of the issue develops, they will increasingly demand strong action by public authorities. Public discussion is itself a crucial ingredient of policy.<\/p>\n<p>Businesses around the world have told us that they need a \u2018long, loud, and legal\u2019 framework with clear policy signals, credible over the medium to long term, if they are to play their part. With such a framework, the transition to a low-carbon economy would produce enormous business opportunities, creating demand for new products and financial services worth hundreds of billions a year.<\/p>\n<p>In contrast, \u2018business as usual\u2019 is not an option. Unabated climate change risks raising average global temperatures by over 5\u00b0C \u2013 equivalent to the difference between now and the last Ice Age. This would take humankind into uncharted territory. Economic activity would be increasingly affected as higher temperatures, heavier storms, longer droughts, more frequent floods and rising sea levels exert an ever-heavier toll. India, along with many Asian countries, would be hit very hard by the retreat of snows and glaciers from the Himalayas. This, as PM Manmohan Singh has said would severely damage \u2018the water tower\u2019 for the region, causing uncontrollable torrents and flooding in the rainy season and dry rivers at other times. The monsoon would probably be badly diverted, with Africa hit particularly hard. Throughout the world there would be serious damage from floods, droughts, storms and sea level rise. At temperature increases of this magnitude, much of the area around the equator would be uninhabitable and there would be a massive movement of population with the ensuing conflict that would result.<\/p>\n<p>Man-made climate change cannot be controlled like the thermostat in your home. Ignoring the problem will undermine our quality of life, change economic growth, undermine the fight against poverty and eventually transform both the physical and human geography of the world.<\/p>\n<p>Climate change is a global problem, and demands a global response. North America and Europe have produced around 70 per cent of the world\u2019s CO2 emissions from energy production since 1850. But fast-growing and highly populated developing nations, like China and India, will account for most of the increases this century. China\u2019s total emissions are likely to overtake US levels by 2010, although they will still be using far less energy per person. If their growing energy requirements are to be met without damaging the planet, they will have to draw on the expertise and technologies that the businesses of the developed world have to offer. It is crucial that any global deal encourages the growth ambitions of the poorer countries of the world, including India. The problem of climate change is inequitable: the rich countries have responsibility for most of the concentration now with us and poor countries are hit earliest and hardest. The global response must take this carefully into account.<\/p>\n<p>As part of an equitable response, rich countries must promote a flow of carbon finance to developing countries and demonstrate and share technologies. They must also deliver on aid promises of the last decade, since development in the context of climate change will be much more difficult and costly.<\/p>\n<p>Despite the size of the challenge ahead, there are reasons to be optimistic. If we act now, and work internationally, we can reduce the risks drastically at modest cost. But if we delay even 10 or 20 years, the costs will be much higher, and the risks much greater. The risks will be most pronounced for developing countries, but it is the rich countries that must take the load. Our children\u2019s future depends on what we as a world decide now. With strong and urgent action, governments, businesses and individuals, working together we can safeguard growth and prosperity.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":null,"article_publishing_date":"November 2007","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"42","name":"Nicholas","created":"2011-10-07 12:51:07","modified":"2013-01-22 17:14:10","slug":"stern-nicholas","family_name":"Stern","title":"","email_address":"","photo_legacy":"","profile_text":"<p>Nicholas Stern\u00a0is the IG Patel Chair and chair of the LSE Asia Research Centre.<\/p>","organization":"Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, London School of Economics and Political Science","role":"IG Patel Professor of Economics and Government","additional_affiliations":"","qualifications":"","staff_pages_blurb":"<p>Lord Stern is IG Patel Professor of Economics and Government at London School of Economics, and head of the India Observatory and Chairman of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment.

For over a decade, our research at LSE Cities has focused on the relationship between the physical and social dimensions of cities. Now, we have turned our attention to the digital and ecological age, to better understand how its technologies and infrastructures \u2013 powered by electricity \u2013 are transforming our urban futures, at a social and environmental level.<\/p>\n<p>Electricity shaped the architecture of cities at the turn of the last century. Arc lighting, elevators and trams revolutionised the urban landscape and habits of many western cities as they expanded rapidly to absorb urban migrants. Electricity completely transformed cities and urban lifestyles, especially in public transport. The widespread introduction of petrol-based vehicles in the post-World War II era cities led to a reconfiguration of the urban landscape. Yet today, electric power continues to fuel the massive expansion in public utilities, transport, domestic appliances and modern commodities that characterise the \u2018urban age\u2019 where cities consume over 60 per cent of world\u2019s energy and contribute to nearly 80 per cent of global CO2 emissions. <\/p>\n<p>Skyscrapers and suburbs, commuting and sprawl, ghettos and CBDs have all followed on from these past waves of technological innovation. Cities have grown taller and fatter in the space of a few generations. Property values have gone up and slums have been created. Commuting times have escalated in some cities while others have rediscovered the efficiencies of the compact city, building on the synergies of increased proximity and more efficient public transport.<\/p>\n<p>Today, electricity is re-emerging as a common denominator of a new technological revolution as unprecedented advances in information and communication systems are matched by radical innovation in green energy technologies and infrastructures. Much of this pervasive innovation nexus of power and information is, and will continue to be, centred in cities. Smart grid technology and the internet of things, battery-powered vehicles and shared urban mobility, GPS enabled apps for smart phones and integrated mobility services, online retail and virtual consumption, digital collaboration and e-governance are already part of our everyday urban experiences.<\/p>\n<p>The more electricity generation is based on renewables \u2013 such as solar, wind and bio-fuels \u2013 the more electrification can deliver the greening of energy systems and cities. Electric mobility, electrically-powered gadgets and systems, and even electric heating and cooling can help make cities more environmentally balanced, offering more than just cleaner energy. Today innovation can be found both in the public sector and in private companies. Cities like Berlin, Paris and San Francisco have been proactive in leading on this transition by combining e-mobility with car-sharing. BMW, Peugeot and Toyota are re-inventing engineering paradigms for cars, concentrating on compact, light, and energy efficient electric vehicles as part of multi-modal provision of mobility in cities. Utility companies are beginning to use electric vehicles to store renewable energy that needs to be taken off the grid during peak loads.<\/p>\n<p>But, as the visionary British architect Cedric Price noted over 40 years ago \u2018Technology is the answer. But what is the question?\u2019 The Urban Age Electric City conference has been designed to re-formulate these questions and initiate a new line of research that addresses the wider social, political and cultural impacts of the new technologies. <\/p>\n<p>Some of the results of this research are presented in the Data Section of this newspaper. It includes an overview of the global geography of energy consumption and explores where and how electricity is generated and where CO2 emissions are most prominent in different regions of the world. The section goes on to investigate the physical structure, governance arrangements and environmental performance of twelve case studies, adding to the accumulated knowledge of Urban Age cities fresh evidence form six \u2018green pioneers\u2019 like Copenhagen, Portland and Bogota. <\/p>\n<p>These cities, alongside Singapore, Hong Kong, Stockholm, New York and Berlin have made a step-change in sustainable and policies practice, often led by visionary mayors and an enlightened electorate. We also take a closer look at how London and its directly elected mayors have performed, after a decade of effective metropolitan governance, noting that residential waste and car ownership have dropped substantially, while fossil-fuel dependency, air pollution and per capita levels of consumption remain unacceptably high. <\/p>\n<p>In parallel to this quantitative overview, we engage with some of the more profound sociological, cultural and political questions of the electric urban age though essays and provocations included in this newspaper and the conference itself. Architectural and urban critic Deyan Sudjic defines electricity as both an idea and a thing. It has theoretical and practical implications. It is the combination of the two which has resulted in a particularly strong impact on cities. As such, electricity is an invisible technology but its physical manifestations as basic innovations are easy to detect. History, can help us since, in some ways, we have been there before. The impact of basic innovations on cities is omnipresent, a theme elaborated by Climate Change economist Nick Stern and his colleagues, who argue that cities have both increased their appetite for consumption but also been at the vanguard of sustainable solutions which \u2018decouple higher living standards and increasing resource consumption.\u2019 <\/p>\n<p>Author of <em>Triumph of the City<\/em> Ed Glaeser picks up the baton on relating form to environmental performance, highlighting the economic and environmental benefits of higher densities of city living and working as a prerequisite of urban sustainability. He critiques the US model of profligate car-dependency and urban sprawl, urging emerging countries like India and China to take note that much can be achieved by tight and visionary urban leadership and the adoption of the compact city model. Bruce Katz turns the spotlight onto the green economy and jobs, highlighting research from the Brookings Institution that identifies the potential of the green economy for the renaissance of US metros, a theme that is echoed by Max Nathan analysis of London\u2019s growing digital economy sector and the dynamism of the Tech-city initiative. <\/p>\n<p>Sociologist John Urry reminds us of the difficulty to predict potential development pathways particularly when technology is disruptive with respect to existing practices. Instead, he offers four scenarios of what a potential future might be \u2018after the car\u2019, informed by our acceptance of electric hypermobility. Saskia Sassen analyses the effects of such rapid transitions and the effect that technologies have on urban space. She both endorses the effects but recognises the limits of intelligent systems in cities, arguing that the next phase of technological development is charged with negative social potentials where we could slide \u2018into a managed space where <em>sensored<\/em> becomes <em>censored<\/em>.\u2019 Carlo Ratti and Anthony Townsend extend this argument by highlighting the potential of new systems of information and communication on the virtual infrastructure of cities and on their impacts on networks of associations and interactions. <\/p>\n<p>In their essays, Richard Sennett and the Milgram Group reflect on the \u2018stupefying\u2019 effect of smart cities, analysing how the new urban environments of Songdo and Masdar currently being shaped by a new generation of urban infrastructures remain alien and lack the visual and creative energies of conventional urban form. By identifying historical precedent, Sennett warns that new tools can have deadening rather than liberating effects and that our first instinct is to blame the machine itself instead of asking ourselves how new urban technologies can be used more intelligently, raising questions about urban design and people engagement.  Dan Hill and Maarten Hajer delve deeper into the social dimensions of smart cities in an ecological age, arguing for greater awareness and experimentation in the use of new urban technologies and making more of their political potential. In his closing overview, the <em>Politics of Climate Change<\/em>, Tony Giddens reflects on how technological innovation has to be a core part of any successful climate change strategy, but that the state and government must have a significant role in making such innovation possible, suggesting that now is time to call for a \u2018return to planning\u2019.<\/p>\n<p>This brief synopsis of the arguments laid out in this newspaper suggests that we are not taking the Electric City at face value. We use this term as a catch-phrase to capture the social, economic, cultural and political complexities of what comes under the general banner of \u2018smart cities\u2019. We recognise that these dimensions need to be better understood before new technologies are accepted by citizens who are highly sceptical of technological fixes and worried about affordability and data protection. At the same time, urban policymakers and city leaders seem hesitant to embrace change and impose untested technologies. They are also concerned about the risks of investing in what might turn out to be the \u2018wrong\u2019 technology at extremely high costs. It is out hope that this conference will stimulate debate and bring clarity, offering new insights into the social and environmental sustainability of cities.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":"","article_publishing_date":"December 2012","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"53","name":"Ricky","created":"2011-10-11 21:01:44","modified":"2014-02-04 12:29:29","slug":"burdett-ricky","family_name":"Burdett","title":"","email_address":"r.burdett@lse.ac.uk","photo_legacy":"","profile_text":"Ricky Burdett is Professor of Urban Studies and Director of LSE Cities.","organization":"LSE Cities, London School of Economics and Political Science","role":"Director","additional_affiliations":"Professor of Urban Studies, London School of Economics and Political Science Global Distinguished Professor, New York University","qualifications":"","staff_pages_blurb":"Ricky Burdett is Professor of Urban Studies, and director of LSE Cities and the Urban Age Programme.

This shift has come at a time when most of the cities in these countries were reportedly experiencing a \u2018phenomenal demographic growth\u2019 and consequent crisis in the provision of adequate urban infrastructure. The incapacity of the state and local governments to make adequate investments to alleviate this crisis has led to a process of government restructuring and reduction of public expenditure in many Indian cities.<\/p>\n<p>The need to free the market from the state\u2019s regulative framework to facilitate private investment in infrastructure and the empowerment of local government are central components of an emerging urban strategy in India. This has led to the development of capital markets for resource mobilisation and efforts to ensure the cost of the provision of urban infrastructure, through elimination or reduction of government subsidies. Simplification of the legislative system and flexibility to bring about appropriate land use changes and location of economic activities have likewise been advocated as a part of the remedial package for Indian cities and city regions.<\/p>\n<p>The proponents of this neo-liberal strategy argue that it will accelerate rural-to-urban migration, boost the pace of urbanisation, promote regional balance and ensure sustainable development in the country. Critics of the strategy, on the other hand, have argued that globalisation could jeopardise sustainable development both in rural and urban areas and accelerate the exodus from rural areas. There is little research evidence that supports either of these perspectives. There is a point of convergence between the two that envisages that rapid urbanisation and acceleration of growth will be concentrated mainly in large cities of the Indian subcontinent. The trend is backed by statistics which confirm \u2018exceptional urban growth\u2019 in these centres during the 1950s and 1970s , but this \u2018hyper-urbanisation\u2019 theory has influenced the assumptions behind many official population projections which that have tended to overestimate urban growth and err on the high side.<\/p>\n<p>The recent projections by the Population Division of the United Nations are somewhat low, with the projected figure of 3.0 per cent for 1991\u20132001 which was indeed higher than the actual numbers recorded by the Population Census for the same period. It is important to remember that the growth rate of the urban population in India during the 1970s was 3.9 per cent, dropping down to 3.1 per cent in the 1980s, one of the lowest in this century. This dropped even further to 2.7 per cent during the 1990s. If these trends continue, the level of urbanisation will drop below 40 per cent by 2050, less than what has been projected by most national and international organiszations. The methodology many of these studies assume is that the urban rural growth differential will increase or remain stable until a 50 per cent level of urbanisation is reached. In reality this growth rate has started coming down well before reaching the 50 per cent threshold in India as well as in several other less-developed countries.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-167\" title=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/10\/07_ref_The%20future%20of%20Indian%20Cities2.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"396\" height=\"490\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Given these recent trends, which indicate a slowing down of urban growth, the notion of \u2018unprecedented urbanisation\u2019 in India over the next three decades must be questioned, along with the proposed policies that recommend the opening up of land and capital markets to resolve the problems of urban infrastructure.<\/p>\n<p>The analysis of current development dynamics and their impacts on urban systems suggest that the process of urbanisation is unlikely to increase sharply over the next few decades. This is partly due to a decline in the natural growth of the population and partly to slower rates of rural-to-urban migration. The decline in demographic growth in small and medium towns is likely to be more marked than in larger cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Chenai, Kolkata and Bangalore.<\/p>\n<p>Given the effects of globalisation and more general macro-economic trends, it is likely that the bulk of industrial and infrastructural development will concentrate in and around a few large cities, not small towns and backward regions. Large municipal corporations, particularly those located in states with a strong economic base, enjoy a higher capacity of resource mobilisation which will stimulate economic and demographic growth in these regions \u2013 not in smaller towns and rural areas.<\/p>\n<p>It is also relevant to note that the fastest growing industries in India have low employment potential within the \u2018formal\u2019 labour market. Even the sustained 7\u20138 per cent growth per annum of recent years is unlikely to generate very large numbers of employment in the private corporate sector. In addition, many of the public sector units are rationalising their workforce with a substantial reduction in numbers of formal employees. Significant employment growth in the large cities is thus likely to take place through a process of subcontracting, using casual and self-employed workers who are not covered by any social security system. In addition, recent trends show that the sharp increase in urban casual workers that has contributed substantially to the migration patterns in recent decades is showing a significant decline. Another significant factor that accounts for the slowing down of in-migration in urban areas.<\/p>\n<p>The sluggish growth in manufacturing employment in urban areas can also be attributed to the location of large units outside the municipal limits. This is due in part to the impact of the environment lobby in big cities that has campaigned against the dangers of pollution in urban areas. Industrial dispersal in non-urban areas is likely to continue due the availability of land and access to unorganised labour markets, as well as less awareness of the environmental agenda and less stringent implementation of environmental regulations in peripheral areas. As a result, the poor will continue to be pushed to out to these \u2018degenerated peripheries\u2019 and commute to the city for jobs in the industries driven out of the central areas. The middle and professional classes, however, are likely to stay in the inner city. This segmented structure of demographic growth could divert prospective migrants to the urban peripheries, swollen by increasing numbers of evicted urban slum dwellers.<\/p>\n<p>Empirical evidence suggests that the profile of the emerging informal sector will be different from the recent past, experiencing a degree of formalisation resulting from regular forms of employment. Employers and entrepreneurs seeking to take advantage of increasingly global markets have come to recognise that they would loose their competitive edge unless they standardise their products to meet the specifications of the customers and respect delivery schedules. As a result, they are seeking to establish a degree of \u2018formalisation within the informal sector\u2019. Most of the rapidly growing businesses in Indian cities engaged in small-scale manufacturing, trade, commerce and finance that have direct or indirect global linkages are beginning to employ workers on a more regular basis. Furthermore, professionals working in global businesses, who work long hours, are increasingly searching for higher levels of certainty in their living arrangements in order to meet the demanding job requirements. As a result, domestic help and other supporting household services are likely to follow a similar process of regularisation.<\/p>\n<p>This process of \u2018formal informalisation\u2019 has several other implications. Many of the rural migrants, lacking in basic levels of literacy, communication skills or market awareness will find it increasingly difficult to get a foothold in the more demanding urban job market. Consequently, urban India faces a paradox. Despite unprecedented growth in employment, it will continue to experience high levels of unemployment in the future, especially at the heart of its cities.<\/p>\n<p>The decline in real wages of casual urban workers in the five-year period 1999\u20132004, among both men and women, further questions the benefits of this growth on the informal workforce. There has also been a decline in real wages of regular workers in the formal employment sector who seem to be missing out on the benefits of globalisation. Only a fraction of the total labour force in India, made up of educated professional classes, has been able to maintain their real wages.<\/p>\n<p>Local governments in many of the Indian cities are currently facing two serious problems in attracting foreign and national businesses and investment. The first is the land scarcity in inner city areas, especially in prime urban locations. The second is lack of capital. Many cities employ ingenious planning and fiscal methods to attract companies, in an attempt to solve this double problem. The Floor Space Index (FSI), which regulates the level of high- density development allowed in the central areas for commercial offices and high-income residential units, is designed to promote vertical growth in high land-value areas. The aim is to provide much needed space for businesses and, at the same time, generate resources to pay for improvements in infrastructure by selling the extra FSI \u2013 or, in other words, allowing much higher levels of development to pay for public infrastructure. In addition, increased FSI is being required by more and more companies since the sanctioning of loans by the international agencies are becoming contingent on the acceptance of higher FSI in city centre areas. The impact of these regulations on the levels of density and the skyline of Indian cities is becoming very apparent. Attempts are thus being made in a selection of India\u2019s \u2018select global centres of the future\u2019 to provide land in preferred sites to the market. This is being implemented by simplifying the legal and administrative procedures for changing land use and by pushing out \u2018low-value\u2019 activities from these sites. Low-income and slum areas are the obvious candidates for relocation to the city peripheries, often through the eviction of slum dwellers, hawkers, and pavement dwellers. Importantly, the 74th Constitutional Amendment Act makes it possible to provide differentiated levels of amenities in large cities, based on willingness of the users to pay for their services. The middle and professional classes\u2019 preference for low- density development, in safe and clean settings, ensures that higher quality infrastructure and services are provided in \u2018their\u2019 areas, with limited levels of new construction and no illegal encroachment from new slum development. Low levels of infrastructure and service, lack of basic amenities, poor living conditions and deteriorating law and order are likely to continue in low-income areas, acting as a strong disincentivess for further in-migration of the poor.<\/p>\n<p>Form the above it is clear that the shift from centralised planning to free-market development may, in fact, reduce rather than fuel urban growth in India, even in the larger cities which are successfully attracting new infrastructure and investment. This process, however, is likely to institutionalise disparity and strengthen the process of segmenting cities into rich and poor areas.<\/p>\n<p>Given the socio-political reality in India, it is difficult for the private sector to bring about the changes in the management of the urban land market, land use planning, and infrastructure and investment patterns without the state becoming a partner. Proposed changes in the system of governance and urban planning, recommended by international agencies, envisage the state\u2019s role as an active facilitator. Indian states have indeed responded quite favourably to these recommendations by ushering in the necessary changes, although the democratic structure and bureaucratic inertia have made the process somewhat slow. The message, however, comes loud and clear, from the Tenth Plan document and from the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission, that such changes are possible and forthcoming.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":null,"article_publishing_date":"November 2007","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"39","name":"Amitabh","created":"2011-10-04 14:52:21","modified":"2011-10-04 15:52:21","slug":null,"family_name":"Kundu","title":null,"email_address":null,"photo_legacy":null,"profile_text":"","organization":"","role":"","additional_affiliations":null,"qualifications":null,"staff_pages_blurb":null,"office_location":null,"display_after":null,"display_until":null,"extended_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb_lang2":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation_lang2":null,"phone_number":null}],"attachments":false,"gallery":{"slug":false,"extra_classes":"","slides":[]}},{"request_language":"","current_page_uri":"\/media\/search-dev.json","lang2_slug":false,"lang2_name":false,"parent_publication_id":7,"featured_image_uri":"","article_title":"The German Metropolitan System","permalink":"the-german-metropolitan-system","article_subtitle":"An Alternative to the Global City?","article_abstract":"","article_summary":"","article_text":"","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":"http:\/\/v0.urban-age.net\/0_downloads\/\/Berlin_Dieter_Lapple_2006-German_Metropolitan_Networks.pdf","article_publishing_date":"November 2006","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"55","name":"Dieter","created":"2011-10-11 21:06:34","modified":"2013-10-19 22:30:01","slug":"laepple-dieter","family_name":"L\u00e4pple","title":"","email_address":"","photo_legacy":"","profile_text":"Dieter L\u00e4pple is Professor Emeritus of International Urban Studies at the HafenCity University in Hamburg and Non- resident Senior Fellow in the Metropolitan Policy Program of the Brookings Institution in Washington.

With a focus on regional and global intersections in the political economy, Saskia Sassen outlines the trends that place the future of Istanbul at the forefront of these flows.<\/p>\n","article_summary":"","article_text":"<p>From a distance, Istanbul is the immutable intersection of vast and diverse mobilities. It reaches across the East-West and the North-South axes of the world, and all their possible variants. Out of these histories of intersections comes the need to develop specific capabilities for handling and enhancing network functions; it is not simply a question of location at intersections. It seems to me that developing such capabilities across diverse histories and geographies is a particularity of Istanbul\u2019s deep history. It is also one of growing importance in today\u2019s networked world. Several major trends make this visible. Here I limit myself to three.<\/p>\n<p>A first trend concerns the flows of capital: Istanbul is at the centre of a geography of capital flows that stretches both East and West. Even though the EU is Turkey\u2019s dominant trade and investment partner, current post-Cold War geopolitics make Asian countries increasingly important.<\/p>\n<p>The second trend concerns the in- and outflows of people, and here again we see a remarkable bi-modality between Europe and Asia. The diversity of people migrating to and through Istanbul raises a question about the specific forms of knowledge that arise out of these intersections, about the contents at the heart of networked flows at a time of growing worldwide articulation among diverse complex cultures.<\/p>\n<p>The answer, perhaps, is reflected in a third trend coming out of a study of the top 60 cities in the world in terms of political and cultural variables. Istanbul, that city of intersections and mobilities, sits in the top 30, specifically as a global policy nexus, and as a city for human capital and talent. Below, I will work through each trend in more detail.<\/p>\n<p>In terms of capital flows, Turkey\u2019s dominant trade and investment partnership is with the EU. In 2007, trade between Turkey and the EU stood at US$ 12.4 billion, an astounding thirty-fold increase over the 1990 to 2000 annual average. Of all EU countries, the Netherlands\u2019 US$ 5.7 billion made it by far the largest single investor in Turkey, with a group of smaller EU countries together accounting for another US$ 4.9 billion. The long history of economic interactions with Europe since World War II and during the Cold War has fed this overwhelming dominance.<\/p>\n<p>But Asia is rising fast. At the end of 2007, by far the two largest recipients of Turkish foreign direct investment (FDI) were the Netherlands and Azerbaijan, a striking juxtaposition that fully captures Turkey\u2019s geographic articulation of East and West. They were followed by Malta, Luxembourg, Germany, the US, and Kazakhstan. As for the major sectors of this FDI, the Construction and the Real Estate industries together account for 20 per cent of the foreign firms operating in Turkey. Turkish construction companies work in a large number of foreign countries too, with the most significant concentration of cumulative value from 1980 to 2009 in Italy (US$ 102 billion), Libya (US$ 50 billion), and Ukraine (US$ 21 billion). A number of countries follow, with cumulative investments ranging between US$ 10 and 16 billion, including Switzerland, Luxembourg, Russia and Sudan, once again highlighting Turkey\u2019s bridging of different historical geographies.<\/p>\n<p>Along with a trade orientation that spans its geopolitical region (see \u2018Regional Context\u2019 on page 38 of this newspaper), there has been a dramatic increase in Turkey\u2019s total FDI stock abroad. By 2007, Turkey\u2019s FDI stood at US$ 12.2 billion, an eleven-fold increase compared to 1990 (US$ 1.1 billion) and three-and-a-half-fold compared to 2000 (US$ 3.7 billion). Similarly, while capital began flowing out of Turkey at exponential rates, by 2007 the inward flow of FDI stood at US$ 146 billion, a thirteen-fold increase over 1990 (US$ 11 billion), and seven-and-a-half fold compared to 2000 (US$ 19.2 billion). It is the combination of capital flowing in and out, to and through the region that marks the intersection of capital mobilities in Istanbul. Such a dramatic increase in capital relations across and within the region within two decades has led to the developing capacity of Istanbul\u2019s changing manufacturing, financial and service industries, now a magnet for human capital and innovation.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-720\" title=\"02_00\" src=\"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/11\/02_00.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"731\" height=\"532\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The draw of Istanbul is not lost on foreign firms looking for a city in which to locate their headquarters. Of the more than 19,000 foreign firms operating in Turkey, well over half are headquartered in Istanbul. About 10,700 are EU firms, including 3,100 from Germany and 1,800 from Britain. At the other end, 4,300 foreign firms are from Asia, including 910 from Iran, 450 from Azerbaijan, and 300 from China. While EU firms are still dominant, the rise of Asia and the changing geopolitics of its immediate region put Istanbul at the centre of a vast space now characterised by the co-presence of multiple and diverse firms and projects from all over the world. According to a study of the future of European cities, Istanbul is one of the key cities in what is considered to be emergent Europe, a geographic space that runs between Western Europe and West Asia.<\/p>\n<p>While capital flows are one way of identifying economic relations extending to and through the city, the flow of people brings skills, inventiveness, and cultures. These are all elements easily overlooked in debates about migration. The fine grain of cultures shaped by people on the move and by the intersections of global and local get wired into cities, and feed \u2018cityness\u2019. All of this has inflected Istanbul\u2019s unique geopolitics and cultures.<\/p>\n<p>As of 2006, Turkey\u2019s global emigration map was still dominated by one recipient country: Germany. Whether we are counting the 1.7 million Turkish nationals, the 2.7 million born in Turkey, though not necessarily holding Turkish nationality, or the even larger number of second and third generation Turkish-Germans who now, thanks to a recent change in Germany\u2019s naturalisation law, no longer hold an ambiguous citizenship status, the Turkish presence in Germany is very strong. The next largest foreign resident Turkish populations are in France (229,000), the Netherlands (171,000), Austria (150,000) and Belgium (111,000), followed by a large number of countries with smaller numbers: from Sweden with just under 100,000 to Russia with 2,000.<\/p>\n<p>The global geography of Turkish emigration is changing. Mirroring the flows of capital that move East and West, major destinations of people leaving Turkey continue to be European, but in addition we see growing, although still smaller, flows to Asia. Cumulative departures from 2000 to 2006 were 322,000 to Germany, 57,000 to France, and 55,700 to Austria, followed by smaller numbers to a variety of other countries. But the dominance of Turkey\u2019s relationship with the EU can mask the shifting geography of its migrations. In 2006, for example, departures for Germany numbered 30,000, followed by 20,000 to Saudi Arabia, 8,300 to France, and a number of smaller, but significant, flows to the post-Soviet Asian republics.<\/p>\n<p>Migration into Turkey is small, with only 1.9 per cent foreign-born among the total population, a figure that includes return migrants from Germany and elsewhere. But also here we see new geographies of origin, beyond the EU. In 2006, 191,000 foreigners moved into Turkey, mostly from Bulgaria and Azerbaijan. These two nationalities also dominated the cumulative inflow from 2000 to 2006, with 373,700 from Bulgaria, 73,000 from Azerbaijan, while only 48,400 migrated from Germany. These dominant in-flows were followed by smaller, but significant populations coming from Greece, Russia, the US, Iran, Iraq, the United Kingdom, and elsewhere. The origins of migrations are shifting from West to East. Most of the in-flow comes from Bulgaria and Azerbaijan, while most of the out-flow goes to Germany and France.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_721\" style=\"width: 697px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-721\" title=\"02_01\" src=\"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/11\/02_01.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"687\" height=\"427\" \/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source: The Global Cities Index by A.T.Kearney with the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and Foreign Policy.<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Another important, but more temporary, intersection of work and national cultures occurs on short-term trips. As is the case in most countries, migration figures are dwarfed by the numbers of foreigners entering Turkey for various short-term purposes as well as citizens coming for short-term visits. In 2006, the largest single purposes for coming were travel, entertainment, culture, and visits to family and friends. And yet people do travel to Turkey for work. In 2006, the largest single groups of foreigners were the 7 million managers and professionals, and another 1.1 million in secondary service professions.<\/p>\n<p>Entries of foreigners reached 19.3 million in 2006, up from 13.7 million in 2004, and 11.3 million in 2001. Between 2001 and 2006, over 23 million people visited Turkey from Germany, nearly 9 million from Russia and the United Kingdom each, 7 million from Bulgaria, and 4 million from Iran. These are far from insignificant numbers. They represent the incredibly diverse range of people moving in and out of the country, each carrying with them specific histories and cultures, feeding Istanbul\u2019s cosmopolitanism.<\/p>\n<p>Some of these emergent geographies of the flows of capital and of people feed into the two final variables I want to discuss. One is the significant role of Istanbul as a centre for global policy exchange. Kearney\u2019s 2009 study of 60 cities along five variables (business activity, human capital, information exchange, culture, and policy engagement), finds Istanbul in the top ten cities worldwide on the policy engagement variable, along with Washington, Beijing, Paris, Cairo, London and Brussels, among others. The study defines the policy engagement variable as \u2018influence on global policy-making and political dialogue.\u2019<\/p>\n<p>The second, which is not unconnected, is the fact that the study finds Istanbul in the top 15 cities on the human capital variable \u2013 defined as a city that \u2018acts as a magnet for diverse groups of people and talent\u2019. Along the other cities in the top group are Tokyo, New York, Hong Kong, Chicago, Sydney and London. In the case of Istanbul, the key factor feeding its high rank is the large number of international schools, which functions as an indicator for characteristics of the parents of these children.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_722\" style=\"width: 381px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-722\" title=\"02_02\" src=\"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/11\/02_02.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"371\" height=\"333\" \/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source: Ernst and Young.

Istanbul is well positioned to gain ground here: even though it is still a country with a very small foreign-born population, it is clear that it has benefited from an enormous variety of origins among its immigrants.<\/p>\n<p>I see both of these prominent positions, in policy engagement and human capital, as having to do with Istanbul\u2019s strategic role at the intersection of diverse economic and geopolitical geographies. In an increasingly networked world, this role and the capabilities involved have taken on growing importance.<\/p>\n<p>Cities have long been at the intersection of cross-border circuits \u2013 flows of capital, labour, goods, raw materials, merchants, travellers. Asia and Africa have seen some of the oldest and vastest of these flows, and Europe some of the densest. Cities were strategic spaces for the economies and cultures that arose out of these flows, for making the capabilities needed to handle and govern these intersections, and for the housing of power \u2013 economic, political, cultural.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-723\" title=\"02_03\" src=\"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/11\/02_03.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"732\" height=\"612\" \/><\/p>\n<p>These circuits are multidirectional and criss-cross the world, feeding into inter-city geographies. The formation of inter-city geographies is today contributing a critical infrastructure for a new global political economy, new cultural spaces, and new types of politics. Some of these inter-city geographies are thick and highly visible \u2013 the flows of professionals, tourists, artists, and migrants among specific groups of cities. Others are thin and barely visible \u2013 the highly specialised financial trading networks that connect particular cities, depending on the type of instrument involved, or the global commodity chains for diverse products that run from exporting hubs to importing hubs.<\/p>\n<p>The vast expansion of the geographies of these flows in the current period has further brought out the importance of cities at these intersections. For some cities, such as Istanbul, this is an old history, for others, such as Miami, a new one. The ascendance of Asia on the world economic and geopolitical map has brought added strategic importance to some of these cities, among which most prominently Istanbul.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":"http:\/\/v0.urban-age.net\/publications\/newspapers\/istanbul\/articles\/02_SaskiaSassen\/en_GB\/02_SaskiaSassen_en.pdf","article_publishing_date":"November 2009","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"2","name":"Saskia","created":"2011-08-24 17:21:14","modified":"2014-05-02 16:17:31","slug":"sassen-saskia","family_name":"Sassen","title":"","email_address":"","photo_legacy":"\/0_images\/02-SSassen.jpg","profile_text":"Saskia Sassen is the Robert S.

Yet, while reducing energy and carbon emissions through more sustainable transport are understood and are being implemented in different urban regions of the world, the connections between urban form, transport infrastructure and social well-being require further analysis. Understanding mobility in cities relies heavily on deterministic, engineering-based models. They tend to rely on a rather rigid, synchronous and static view of cities in which movement patterns are assumed to be the same for all consumers. Instead urban mobility can be approached as a \u2018pliable\u2019 science, one that allows the multiple scales and time zones to be understood through a set of simple modelling tools \u2013 which are in effect time-based accessibility maps \u2013 that do not require expensive and time-consuming techniques. The experience of the modern city changes according to the hour of the day and depending on the mode of transport to access the city\u2019s primary urban provisions \u2013 jobs, shops, leisure and other essential social and community uses. Time, as opposed to distance, is perhaps a more appropriate variable to assess urban functionality. We need to first agree on an average quantum of time that is acceptable to most urban commuters. Research suggests that 45 minutes in each direction, or a total of 1.5 hours per day, is a reasonable time frame for most people to gain access to a range of primary urban functions from their point of departure. While the selection of any such figure may be challenged as controversial, it sets a benchmark against which to evaluate the amount of time spent on commuting by urban dwellers.<\/p>\n<p>To better understand the relationship between urban form and mobility patterns travel times for different modes of transport (public transport and private cars) were tracked in twelve global megacities \u2013 including S\u00e3o Paulo, Los Angeles, London and Tokyo \u2013 to identify how long it takes to get to work, to go out in the evening, to go shopping, to attend a sports event and to go to university. The results show strikingly different results for different modes of travel in relation to the time of day and the activity they pursue.<\/p>\n<p>The diagrams below indicate accessibility maps for the \u2018leisure city\u2019, illustrating journeys from a selected point of departure in the evening to the main area in each city where theatres, cinemas and other facilities are located. The maps on the top show how far one can get within 45 minutes (in green) or 90 minutes (in yellow) by car, while the ones at the bottom indicates how far one can get using public transport.<\/p>\n<p>What stands out is the real strength of cities like London and Tokyo, which have extensive and integrated transport networks that are fully operational even outside traditional working hours. In these cities the accessibility maps roughly cover the same area for both cars and public transport users. A large percentage of the population can reach the city\u2019s leisure districts within 45 minutes regardless of whether they use the car or a combination of bus, rail and metro. Bogot\u00e1 shows a similarly integrated pattern following the implementation of the TransMilenio bus rapid transit system, which carries 25 per cent of all commuters daily, and has seen travel times cut by 30 per cent, carbon emissions by 40 per cent and road accidents by 90 per cent. At the opposite extreme are Los Angeles and S\u00e3o Paulo where a much smaller area is accessible by public transport compared to the car. In Los Angeles the amount of people living less than 45 minutes by car from Rodeo Drive is 27 times larger than the amount of people that could get there in 45 minutes by public transport (2.7 million versus 100,000).<\/p>\n<p>The conclusions that can be drawn from these studies confirm that a road- and rail-based public transport system that extends across the surface of large urban areas is critical to providing access to jobs, leisure, shopping and any other primary functions of the city for the majority of its citizens. In Los Angeles, for example, less than 20 per cent of the population of the metropolitan area use public transport to get to work \u2013 a clear case of social exclusion \u2013 while in Tokyo \u2013 still the biggest metropolitan region in the world with 35 million inhabitants \u2013 78 per cent of the population use public transport as part of their daily commute. Many of the most deprived areas of Johannesburg have hardly any public transport system to speak of, and thus access to jobs becomes extremely difficult for those who need it most \u2013 a pattern that is evident in many South American cities where commuting times can exceed three hours a day.<\/p>\n<p>Ultimately, the results suggest that existing public transport networks should be used more intensively, taking into account the requirements of different user groups at different times of the day. For example, while London has an extensive and established bus, rail and metro system, its efficiency suffers from the fact that the entire rail-based system closes down at midnight, forcing many people to use cars to gain access to evening entertainment. But while these studies point to the need for policymakers to take time-based transport planning into account, growing metropolitan regions like S\u00e3o Paulo, Buenos Aires, Lima and Rio de Janeiro need to invest in an integrated cocktail of measures that include improvements in regional connectivity, the implementation of bus rapid transport technology, reserved lanes for public transport and cycle networks, and the introduction of traffic management policies such as an alternating number plate system and congestion charging. Only by approaching transport in a holistic way can urban policymakers begin to offer their citizens sustainable solutions.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_51\" style=\"width: 406px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/08\/05_SA08Ref_Casiroli1.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-51 \" title=\"Travel by car\" src=\"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/08\/05_SA08Ref_Casiroli1.jpg\" alt=\"Travel by car\" width=\"396\" height=\"395\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Travel by car<\/p><\/div>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_52\" style=\"width: 406px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/08\/05_SA08Ref_Casiroli2.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-52 \" title=\"Travel by public transport\" src=\"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/08\/05_SA08Ref_Casiroli2.jpg\" alt=\"Travel by public transport\" width=\"396\" height=\"395\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Travel by public transport<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":"http:\/\/v0.urban-age.net\/0_downloads\/archive\/_SA\/05_NewsPaper_Essay_Casiroli.pdf","article_publishing_date":"December 2008","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"5","name":"Fabio","created":"2011-08-30 11:01:22","modified":"2011-08-30 14:47:57","slug":"fabio","family_name":"Casiroli","title":null,"email_address":null,"photo_legacy":null,"profile_text":"<p>Fabio Casiroli is a visiting professor at DPA Milan Polytechnic.

To capture its non-stop economic progress and successive waves of immigrants, the city adopted \u2018S\u00e3o Paulo: cidade que n\u00e3o pode parar\u2019 as its slogan \u2013 the city that is not able to stop.<\/p><\/div>\n<p>The city of S\u00e3o Paulo and its Metropolitan Region form without a doubt a multicultural whole. The list of cultural diversities that characterises them is extensive and complex, which is not only due to waves of foreign immigration since 1870, but is also a result of the diversity that characterised this immigration.<\/p>\n<p>The most significant of them, the immigration of Italians, was not actually \u2018Italian\u2019 per se. Theirs did not constitute an influx of tens of thousands of immigrants coming from Italy proper. They came from a newly unified Italy, a new state and nation while they originated from many political realities, and hailed from regional cultures that formed the map of Italian diversity, unified by the Risorgimento. They arrived here speaking their regional dialects, bringing local customs and traditions with them. In some of S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s neighbourhoods people still speak Portuguese with a Neapolitan, Calabrian, Venetian or Mantovanian accent.<\/p>\n<p>They became \u2018Italians\u2019 in Brazil, through their children who possibly went to Italian schools to learn their parent\u2019s native language. S\u00e3o Paulo became a city characterised by cultural duplications, where people would speak their mother tongue, whichever it was, at home, and speak Portuguese with a strong foreign accent on the streets. It is no coincidence, then, that the engineer Alexandre Marcondes Machado invented an ironic Italian-Paulistano dialect in his literary work, under the pseudonym Ju\u00f3 Bananare, and that his first book, La Divina Increnca, published in 1915 \u2013 a parody on Dante\u2019s Divine Comedy \u2013 imagined multiculturalism as confusion instead of an encounter.<\/p>\n<p>Since the beginning of the twentieth century, Portuguese with a foreign accent mixed with foreign words has been the language of comedy in the work of different authors in S\u00e3o Paulo. This was not meant to be ironic about the immigrants, but to provide an external point of view that could highlight, in a critical way, the municipal and political absurdities of the city, which was being transformed through the influx of money from the coffee export: money that would be multiplied in the financial world, in industry and in trade. Money that also disrupted social relations, especially social differences, took away prejudices and in a short time inverted relations of dominance and power.<\/p>\n<p>In his book, Bananere traces a portrait of intense sounds, of the daily mentality of the population of S\u00e3o Paulo in the 1920s and 1930s, their ways of recognising the city and living the contradictions of life. Immigrants had become Brazilians by the time they had grandchildren, in a process of slow cultural migration to the culture of the society they had adopted, which wasn\u2019t a strong culture either, but rather a patchwork of contributions from various sources, among them Italian regional cultures and foreign immigrants in general. The work of an Italian descendant \u2013 Jo\u00e3o Rubinato \u2013 illustrates this. He made a move in the opposite direction of Bananere, by adopting a Brazilian pseudonym: Adoniran Barbosa. His musical and popular compositions talk \u2013 also ironically \u2013 about the life of simple people and are written in a residual Brazilian language, mixed with traces of the Italian accent of the working-class neighbourhoods of S\u00e3o Paulo. Many people believe that this was a made-up language, like in Bananere\u2019s book. However, in reality Rubinato spoke exactly like that. When dealing with matters of daily life in the city, as in \u2018Saudosa Maloca\u2019 and \u2018Trem das Onze\u2019, he transformed the accent into a disguised ironic language that tells of the small daily dramas of workers and drunks, just like himself.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_73\" style=\"width: 406px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-73\" title=\"12_SA08Ref_Martins2\" src=\"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/08\/12_SA08Ref_Martins2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"396\" height=\"201\" \/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Bandeiras Monument marking the entrance to Ibirapuera Park was inaugurated in 1953 and pays tribute to the founders of S\u00e3o Paulo.

Among the nearly 19 million residents in the Metropolitan Region are the largest Lebanese population outside of Lebanon, the biggest Japanese community outside of Japan, and the third largest Italian city outside of Italy after Buenos Aires and New York City.<\/p>\n<p>This diversity had countless other important manifestations that showed a kind of recognition and respect for multiculturalism, which separated the new generations of children from the generation of their parents (which involved just one or two cultures). Such was the case with a successful radio programme in the 1940s, the Escolinha of Nh\u00f4 Totico. Nh\u00f4 Totico was the nickname of Vital Fernandes da Silva, who was born in the countryside near S\u00e3o Paulo from an Italian mother and a Brazilian father from Bahia. He had a multicultural background as he was born into and educated in a third culture, the caipira culture, which was formed by old descendants of Indians and whites. In his radio school, Nh\u00f4 Totico performed all the voices of its different characters: the Brazilian professor, as well as the Italian, Spanish, Syrians, Portuguese and Japanese students. He transformed the diversity of origins, so characteristic of S\u00e3o Paulo at that time, into a pluralist panel unified by the school and by the Brazilian teacher, turning it into an invitation to overcome cultural differences through education.<\/p>\n<p>Later in the 1950s, the vast and intense stream of immigrants from north-eastern Brazil, expelled by the crisis in sugarcane farming caused by episodes of drought, and attracted by the new industrialisation developed by the car industry, made the culture of S\u00e3o Paulo even more diverse. Not only by the way they spoke, but also because of their kitchen and customs, the Nordestinos from North-Eastern Brazil added to the S\u00e3o Paulo culture specific traces of their own. Like there are typically Italian, Spanish, Arab, German, Jewish, Eastern, Russian and Ukrainian neighbourhoods, there are also typically Nordestino neighbourhoods in S\u00e3o Paulo. In recent decades Latin American immigration has added new colours to the city, particularly through immigration of Bolivians. The culinary cultures of these various national groups, which can be experienced through the many restaurants that represent them, easily make any tourist and the city\u2019s population recognise it as a multicultural city.<\/p>\n<p>The same can be said regarding its religious diversity, with buildings of worship ranging from synagogues to mosques, from Protestant and Evangelical temples to a great diversity of Catholic churches organised around different devotions which are all expressions of cultural diversity. You can follow a Mass with Gregorian singing in the church of S\u00e3o Bento, or a popular Mass in the shrine of Santo Amaro, an Orthodox Mass in Vila Mariana, a Protestant worship in the city centre, a Muslim celebration on the Avenue of the State, a Jewish worship in one of the several synagogues, a session of the Pentecostal cult in a church in Vila Pomp\u00e9ia or in the Baixada do Glic\u00e9rio, a Protestant worship with the sound of balalaicas in a church of Russian immigrants in Vila Prudente, or even a Protestant worship in a Korean church from Luz.<\/p>\n<p>However, S\u00e3o Paulo is multicultural not because it was historically open to diversity and tolerance. On the contrary, it carries the weight of two kinds of slavery in its history, together with the restrictions and prohibitions that all forms of slavery eventually resulted in. First, the indigenous slavery, which formally terminated in the early-eighteenth century, and subsequently black slavery, which was abolished in 1888. In a city with few slaves, one would anticipate slavery to end in several ways. However, it happened not as the result of a generous commitment to the idea of freedom and equality, but because slavery was an obstacle for a society hungry for cheap labour, which had already established a regular flow of immigrants and free workers that could fulfil its demands. In economic terms, slavery was a disadvantage.<\/p>\n<p>Influences from those periods of slavery in the language remain in culinary and religious traditions and in other customs. There are even remnants of hybridisations from the time of indigenous slavery. Saci Parer\u00ea for instance is a mythical being of indigenous origin, which in its African version appears as a black boy with only one leg. As a regular appearance in stories as a naughty character, he still inhabits children\u2019s imagination. His original name, Saci Perer\u00ea, is indigenous. He became a black character in the eighteenth century, when indigenous slavery was abolished and the flow of black slaves to S\u00e3o Paulo increased, especially to the sugar cane plantations that flourished within the Capitania, the state of S\u00e3o Paulo.<\/p>\n<p>Studies by Renato da Silva Queiroz show the Saci Perer\u00ea was a mythical figure related to limits and boundaries, and therefore he usually appears in fences. In the eighteenth century he had crossed the boundaries and passed on to the side of the new ubordinates, the black slaves, taking on their skin colour and identity while continuing to be an indigenous being in a society with social stratification, with more or less rigid boundaries between races, ethnicities and social groups. This cultural transgression of Saci Perer\u00ea was the first highly symbolic demonstration of adaptive multiculturalism in the region of S\u00e3o Paulo.<\/p>\n<p>It is not strange that, at that time, the abbot of S\u00e3o Bento paid a black slave from his Order, a magician, to remove the banzo from his slaves. This means that a representative member of an emblematic Catholic order turned to voodism to have his slaves freed from curses and spells. This is a demonstration of diversity and multiculturalism that do not converge, as if society was composed of a structure of specific and distinct cultural layers, each with its own logic, values and reach. Multiculturalism was, and somehow still is, experienced as a way of life in which people move through different cultures daily, depending on the roles they play in a fragmented life of slow and difficult convergences. This is something that persists in practices such as the attendance at shrines of Umbanda, and some people\u2019s adhesion to Candombl\u00e9 and to traditions of African and black religious orientation, while at the same time moving in entirely different cultural and religious circles.<\/p>\n<p>It is in religion and religiosity, indeed, where we find the most relevant signs of original traditions\u2019 survival, which is a very typical Paulistano way of continuing to be what one once was, rather than ceasing to be what one is. That is what makes S\u00e3o Paulo peculiar and multicultural. Not because it accepts the cultural diversity of those who arrive in it without conflict, but mainly because it ensures each one of the living experience of diversity is allowed to be what it has always been, and at the same time embracing it as the novelty of the daily coexistence of similarities and innovations.<\/p>\n<p>It is therefore not strange to find a Japanese descendant singing Italian tarantelas in a canteen in Bras, still an Italian neighbourhood, or a black man from Bexiga spilling his sins into a priest\u2019s ear in Calabrian during confession. Or to have a Frenchman, such as the sociologist Roger Bastide, who is of Protestant and Calvinist origins, dive into African cultures so deeply that one could say that being black is not based in colour of one\u2019s skin but on the structure of how one dreams. These are examples of how S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s multiculturalism is, essentially, an invitation to continue to be what it always was, and to become someone new and different. It is a call for cultural creativity and for a free and constant move between different cultural standards.<\/p>\n<p>In that sense, the multiculturalism of S\u00e3o Paulo and its surroundings can be better understood as a transitive multiculturalism, which makes it very different from other multicultural metropolises that are characterised by the collage of a certain diversity of cultures. In such cases, we are dealing with a multiculturalism of confinement, where diversity is accepted as an aggregation of cultural differences and not as a way of communication and transit between differences. With this, I am not saying that multiculturalism should be faced in terms of rigid forms of organisation of diversity, but as diversity that may be considered from two opposing cultural trends.<\/p>\n<p>The transitive multiculturalism of S\u00e3o Paulo, despite its historical references tending to confinement, ended up being imposed by the complex need for a multicultural transit in a city that was re-created in an urban, architectural sense, and, in terms of its population, at least thrice in modern times: in the 1880s, 1910s and 1960s. These were culturally cataclysmic moments that added new characters to the scene and at the same time, cancelled out old conspiracies.<\/p>\n<p>The rigidity of cultural traditions and customs softened to allow the new and reciprocal adaptation of the former residents and welcome the new residents. However, it would be wrong to say that Paulistanos are unconditionally open to multiculturalism. They are, in relation to aspects of everyday life, in areas where plurality is inevitable, not failing to recognise that this plurality of coexistence is largely responsible for the breaking down of previous identities and the dilution of possible cultural resistance to change and adaptation. Simultaneously, they are not, when it comes to aspects of their private life, family and community, where they will take care for certain elements not to become mixed up in a pluralistic re-socialisation. As is the case of marriages in some of the cultures that persist in S\u00e3o Paulo, reasonably protected from the outside, especially when they involve rituals between young and old generations, such as Japanese and Korean. It has been typical, however, that the dilution of these obstructions that happens with the passing of generations, which is what characterises the transitivity to which I refer, exists in a meaningful balance with maintaining the essential elements of the cultures of origin and a complete assimilation of what does not conflict with them or complements them.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":"http:\/\/v0.urban-age.net\/0_downloads\/archive\/_SA\/12_NewsPaper_Essay_Martins.pdf","article_publishing_date":"December 2008","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"11","name":"Jos\u00e9 de Souza","created":"2011-08-30 14:20:07","modified":"2011-08-30 15:20:07","slug":"jose-de-souza","family_name":"Martins","title":null,"email_address":null,"photo_legacy":null,"profile_text":"<p>Sociologist Jos\u00e9 de Souza Martins is an Emeritus Professor of the University of S\u00e3o Paulo.

Soares explores the challenges in Brazilian cities in the light of recent public demonstrations.<\/p>\n","article_text":"<h1>Progress as a condition for rebellion<\/h1>\n<p>The series of startling events in June 2013 began with a movement against increasing public transportation costs in S\u00e3o Paulo. Until then, everything seemed business as usual, under the conservative media\u2019s fire, with arrogant declarations made by the right-wing governor and the left-wing mayor, who both refused to even negotiate a reduction in transport fares. The scene was typical and the unfolding events were predictable. At that juncture, the protests seemed to be waning and likely to remain local. But, on the second day of the protests, the military police in S\u00e3o Paulo offered its invaluable contribution to the country\u2019s history, acting with criminal brutality, also against journalists. It was enough to ignite Brazil\u2019s collective spirit. Within a few days the proposed increase in transport costs had been revoked, but the inflamed masses did not retreat.<\/p>\n<p>The starting point is justified. In Rio and S\u00e3o Paulo, workers spend up to four hours every day making their way across urban spaces jammed with cars, which have multiplied in the last decade due to the growth of the middle classes by 40,000 Brazilians. This crisis in urban mobility is the unanticipated and contradictory result of a decrease in inequality together with rapid growth \u2013 one of whose focal points has been the car industry. In addition, the combination of more consumers, more access to education, and the citizenry\u2019s increased cultural appreciation creates a new context. Improvements have converged in such a way that certain situations that in the past would have been tolerated passively, have become unacceptable.<\/p>\n<p>This apparent paradox is not new: in the nineteenth century Alexis de Tocqueville taught us that the social groups most willing to act and react are not the poorest and most powerless, but rather those that have something to lose. This means that the social improvements during Brazil\u2019s last two decades (especially the last ten years) have broadened the slice of the population potentially willing to resist if faced with losing. Those who have risen will not surrender their gains without a fight. What gains, exactly, am I referring to?<\/p>\n<h1>Recent gains in Brazilian society<\/h1>\n<p>Using the Gini coefficient to measure income inequality, Brazil achieved its lowest level [representing less rather than more inequality, eds.] in 2011, the lowest for 51 years since this measurement was introduced in 1960. Between 1960 and 1990, inequality grew from 0.5367 to 0.6091. From that point it decreased until 2010, when it reached 0.5304. It continued to fall in 2011, when it reached the lowest number ever, 0.527. Even though the inequality coefficient was at its lowest ever two years ago, Brazil continues to be one of the twelve most unequal countries in the world.<sup>1<\/sup> Yet luckily, a steady trend is beginning to reverse the inequality at a considerable rate.<\/p>\n<p>In the first decade of the twenty-first century, the compound annual growth rate in income for the wealthiest 10 per cent of Brazilians was 10.03 per cent, while for the poorest 50 per cent it was 67.93 per cent. Ricardo Paes de Barros, director of social policy and research at Brazil\u2019s National Institute for Applied Economic Research (IPEA), points out that the 10 per cent poorest obtained an increase in income per capita of about 7 per cent per year, between 2001 and 2009, only a little lower than the celebrated average growth in per-capita income in China. He estimates that few countries could achieve an outcome comparable to Brazil\u2019s decrease of income inequality between 1999 and 2009. The 10 per cent wealthiest Brazilians held 47 per cent of national income, and that decreased to 43 per cent, while the 50 per cent poorest had 12.65 per cent of total income in 1999, and went on to earn 15 per cent by 2009.<sup>2<\/sup><\/p>\n<p>The fact that stands out most is that in 1993, the year before the implementation of the Plano Real (designed to control inflation), 23 per cent of Brazil\u2019s people lived in extreme poverty. In other words, they did not have access to the income necessary to consume the minimum number of calories required for healthy survival. The Plano Real transformed that devastating situation in one year. In 1995, the first year of Fernando Henrique Cardoso\u2019s first term as President, the percentage of the population in extreme poverty decreased from 23 per cent to 17 per cent. By 2003, the proportion of people in extreme poverty had remained the same. In 2009 it fell to 8.4 per cent. While it is still an excessively high and unacceptable number, it is much lower than it was at the beginning of the 1990s.<\/p>\n<p>In 1993, there were 51 million Brazilians with a monthly household income below R$752 (2011 value, US$450). In 2001, there were 46 million. By 2011, the number had decreased to 24 million. In 1993 there were 41 million Brazilians whose monthly household income was between R$752 and R$1,200, and dropped to 38 million by 2011. On the other hand, there were 45 million people in 1993 whose household income was between R$1,200 and R$5,147 and that figure more than doubled, reaching 105 million by 2011. Note that during the 18 years in question (1993 to 2011), Brazil\u2019s population grew at a slower rate than previous decades. The accelerated growth, seen in the 1940s (when the average birth rate was 2.39) and the 1950s (when it reached 2.99), fell in the 1990s (to 1.64) and even further (to 1.17) in the first decade of the twenty-first century.<sup>3<\/sup><\/p>\n<p>When the dynamics of demography are taken into account, the meaning behind the worthy process of inequality reduction is more effectively revealed. These figures enable Marcelo Neri, economist and former president of the IPEA, to affirm that \u201839.6 million Brazilians entered the tier of the so-called new middle class (class C) between 2003 and 2011 (59.8 million since 1993).\u2019<sup>4<\/sup><\/p>\n<h1>Plural agendas and the collapse of political representation<\/h1>\n<p>The agenda of this evolving political movement is not uniform, and each participant holds up his small sign with a proposal, a criticism, a demand, in formal language or with humour, whether it is against homophobia or the technocratic authoritarianism of governments. Meanwhile, in spite of the immense thematic spectrum, some topics are constant: public transportation, urban mobility, corruption, police brutality, unequal access to justice, more resources for education and health, and fewer resources for building lavish stadiums for the 2014 World Cup, or the 2016 Rio Olympics. In this way, the price of public transport ticket merely put a metonymic chain into circulation in Brazil\u2019s individual and collective imaginary, connecting the most diverse contemporary national issues. And each individual felt motivated to contribute to this epic narrative their own description of what they find to be the fundamental and urgent drama. Note that the legitimacy of the federal government was never seriously questioned.<\/p>\n<p>The common axis, however, underlying these diverse positions, is an indignant proclamation of the collapse of political representation. The protestors have lost faith in parties and politicians who renew their mandates through the electoral system without realising that a mere respect for the rules of the game is not enough to keep democracy on its feet. Since the establishment of the 1988 Constitution, following 21 years of military dictatorship and three hybrid years, Brazil has been a democratic state that follows the rule of law. But democratic institutionalisation came to be seen by the majority of society as a hollow shell, a form without content, taken over by unscrupulous political agents. The formal endorsement of members of parliament and political rulers through the electoral process, in a country where voting is obligatory, does not guarantee legitimacy from society\u2019s point of view. The breakdown of political representation has occurred while the country\u2019s leadership has demonstrated no sign of understanding the magnitude of the abyss that could open up \u2013 and swiftly deepen \u2013 between political institutionalism and the feeling of the majority.<\/p>\n<p>The defining characteristic of the current movement is its intensity. The protests occur in the language of excess: many people, all day long, demonstrating about every possible theme and topic \u2013 and there is always the exalted and violent minority that defaces public property. On the fringes a few professional crooks go along for the ride, as well as those who enjoy destroying things for no reason. Why the passion and intensity? I suggest a hypothesis: the linked political problems and symbolic bonds are, as I explained, interrelated, accentuating one permanent feature: inequality. And this happens in an institutional and normative context, the democratic state under the rule of law, where equality is the declared and reiterated principle. For this reason, negative associations become aggravated, accentuating the emotional intensity with which they are experienced and communicated: anything that condones inequality stands out because it strongly contradicts the expectations created by the constitutional pact. In the end, is the dialogue about citizenship worth it or not?<\/p>\n<h1>Persistent historic inequities<\/h1>\n<p>Despite the very significant reduction in inequality, it persists in many forms. Just as violence and police brutality against the poor and blacks persist. The outrageous inequality between blacks and whites has been decreasing, but it endures, revealing structural racism within the country. Between 1950 and 1980, whites lived 7.5 years longer on average than blacks and mulattos \u2013 classifications used at that time. In 1980, the life expectancy of blacks remained at 59 years. In 1987 the white population lived on average until the age of 72, while the life expectancy of blacks was 64.5. Another lurid confirmation. In 1980 the infant mortality rate of blacks and mulattos was the same as the infant mortality of whites in 1960: 105 out of every 1000 live births. Skin colour, which means nothing according to those who believe in the myth of Brazil\u2019s racial democracy, separated life expectancy among blacks and mulattos \u2013 by 20 years \u2013 from the social advances achieved by the white population, advances that would have been impossible without the labour of the non-whites.<sup>5<\/sup><\/p>\n<p>Marcelo Neri provides revealing data about three phenomena, the historical significance of which is profound. First, the demographic effect of the social construction of Brazilian identity: the portion of society that defines itself as black is growing dramatically. If you compare the last two censuses executed by Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, 2000 and 2010, the number of blacks in Brazil\u2019s population increased by 22.6 per cent. In my mind, the main reason is the growing political consciousness of Afro-descendants, who increasingly acknowledge their colour and what it means with pride.<\/p>\n<p>The second phenomenon studied by Neri is the shocking level of inequality. The probability that a person who calls themselves white is poor is 49 per cent less likely than someone who is black, and 56 per cent less likely than a mulatto. For example, a white illiterate middle-aged woman who lives in a favela in the city of Salvador is 29.4 per cent less likely to be poor than if she is non-white. The 2010 census made clear the colour of economic inequality, indicating that 70 per cent of extremely poor Brazilians are black. I can add other alarming figures regarding violence, public safety and the criminal justice system.<sup>6<\/sup> The Mapa da Viol\u00eancia, published in 2011, reveals that in 2002 to 2008, the number of blacks who had been murdered grew by 20.2 per cent, while the number of white victims of the same crime decreased by 22.3 per cent. There is no doubt that blacks and the poor are the main victims of the worst crime \u2013 premeditated murder \u2013 just as they are the main victims of lethal policy brutality and illegal searches.<\/p>\n<p>The third phenomenon is good news. Between 2001 and 2009, 44.6 per cent of income growth occurred among blacks, 48.2 per cent among mulattos and 21.6 per cent among whites. The growth of the proportion of the black population in Brazil and the extreme significance of increased access by black youths to university \u2013 thanks to the affirmative actions of policies such as the Programa Universidade para Todos (Prouni) and bank loans for blacks \u2013 has created a new scenario that bodes well for the future democratisation of Brazilian society. According to data released by IPEA in its\u00a0<em>Boletim Pol\u00edticas P\u00fablicas: acompanhamento e an\u00e1lise<\/em>\u00a0(No. 19), the net rate of student enrollment among 18- to 24-year-olds grew more than five-fold between 1992 and 2009. While in 1992 only 1.5 per cent of young blacks entered university, in 2009 8.3 per cent pursued higher education. In this period the net rate of enrolment of young whites jumped from 7.2 per cent to 21.3 per cent, and the contingent of black students grew from 20.8 per cent of the total white group in 1992 to 38.9 per cent in 2009.<sup>7<\/sup><\/p>\n<h1>From invisibility to the fight for recognition<\/h1>\n<p>Another important dimension of the current political climate is captured by access to the Internet. In 2011, 115,433,000 Brazilians aged ten or older owned a mobile phone (in 2005, a little less than half, 56,105,000 Brazilians, had mobile phones) and 78,672,000 surfed the web. The growing participation in social networks made the June 2013 protests viable, which then began to depend on the conventional media itself. In addition, it has allowed Brazilians to identify themselves and put in practice the global model of taking over public spaces as a kind of direct democracy or political action not mediated by institutions, parties or representatives. The model recalls the classic idea of direct democracy as the ideal, while not achieving it entirely.<\/p>\n<p>Once begun, the mediations never cease, connecting different institutionalised processes to the energy of the masses in the public squares. What matters in this dramatic scenario are idealised memories and common languages, as if these events were cited mutually creating a virtual constellation of hypertexts.<\/p>\n<p>In this context, it becomes possible to feel included in the transnational narrative about new democracy; to feel pride for those who felt disrespected and invisible before public power; to promote the identification with the persona of the civic hero, where collective political experiences become\u00a0cult\u00a0entertainment for the anti-political (even if it involves the risking of one\u2019s life); to engage in a fraternal and gregarious experience (before an enemy that is abstract and ghostlike while being obviously and immediately identified with the face of a police officer); and, to participate in an experience that fills one\u2019s heart with joy, exalting the emotions and elevating them to an almost spiritual level.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"<p>This text, originally entitled \u2018Ground-shakes in a country of inequalities and paradoxes\u2019, was written just after the June 2013 protests that took place in many of Brazil major cities.

How can the mistakes made by the previous generation of planners be avoided? Planning in the old days was based on forecasting, but the limitations of this method are by now well known. It works best for short-term scenarios and also in cases where present-day trends are to some degree set in stone. In the case of energy forecasting in Britain, for instance, we know that the existing generation of power stations will need replacing within a certain timescale. <\/p>\n<p>We often want to predict the future in order to change it and where our attempts to change it become part of that future. This situation holds in the case of climate change. One way of dealing with it is by <em>backcasting<\/em>: asking what changes have to be made in the present in order to arrive at alternative future states. A successful outcome is imagined in the future, and different scenarios are calculated as to how it might be reached. We are talking therefore of alternative and plural futures, where adjustments, even radical revisions, are made as time unfolds and then built into other scenarios. This approach is essentially the one used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The distinct advantage over traditional forecasting is that it allows much greater space for unforeseen contingencies that might dramatically alter predictions made at any specific date. <\/p>\n<p>The point of backcasting is not to reveal what the future will be, but to weigh up future options and policy goals. Backcasting is especially relevant for environmental and energy planning issues, since they fit the circumstances to which the approach is most relevant. These are that the context is complex, a major reorientation of current trends is demanded and a timescale of several decades or more is involved. There are many examples across the world. A project was instituted in the Netherlands in the late 1990s, for example, to look for alternatives to meat production and consumption. Its key assumption was that by 2040 new protein foods should replace 40 per cent of current meat consumption. The foods would have to be at least as tasty as the most popular forms of meat, while having superior health value, among other qualities. The project considered how tastes might change to promote acceptance of such foods. It concluded that new protein foods could be produced 10-30 times more efficiently than meat, as measured in terms of reducing emissions, while at the same time producing a health bonus1.<\/p>\n<p>Backcasting sounds technocratic. In fact, it almost always involves a visionary element, since, by definition, it projects a future that is different from that seen from the present. Of course, forecasting will not disappear and will continue to be part of government planning. It is obvious that backcasting and forecasting are often complementary. Take, as an example, planning for the future of the water industry in Australia, a country suffering from droughts that are probably influenced by global warming and where water is becoming an ever scarcer resource2. Cynthia Mitchell and Stuart White argue that forecasting can identify policies that will produce results in the short term \u2013 it can help pluck the low-lying fruit. Backcasting is needed to think more radically about future possibilities. Forecasts about security of water supply in urban areas in Australia indicate major problems in guaranteeing adequate supply within a few years. Several policies that could quickly make a difference within the existing water system were identified, such as installing water-efficient shower heads and tap regulators, dual flush toilets, waterless urinals, taps operated by sensors and local water collection and recycling. In Queensland, where there have been prolonged periods of drought, reductions in customer demand of up to 30 per cent have been attained using such measures.<\/p>\n<p>Backcasting, however, has helped suggest more far-reaching innovations. At the moment it is commonly assumed that water, sewage and storm-water systems should be considered and planned for separately. Thinking &#8216;backwards&#8217; from a hypothetical situation of a total water cycle has produced quite a different perspective\u2026<\/p>\n<p>In thinking about planning, especially over the longer term, we find ourselves back with risk and uncertainty. Planning sounds like a straightforward process, but this is far from the case: it is highly complex and contingent. One of the main reasons for this is the fact that predictions, forecasts and plans that are made become themselves part of the universe of events that they are about. In an important sense they have to, since the point is to shape the future. Yet, at the same time, an inherent element of unpredictability is introduced and has to be coped with. Trying to alter public attitudes towards risk is a key part of planning policy\u2026<\/p>\n<h1>A return to planning<\/h1>\n<p>\u2026For most of the time and for the majority of citizens, climate change is an issue at the back of the mind, even if it is a source of worry. It will stay that way unless its consequences become visible and immediate. In the meantime, no strategy is likely to work if it concentrates solely upon provoking fear and anxiety, or if it is based on instructing people to cut down on this or that, and also on expecting them to monitor that process on a continuous basis. <\/p>\n<p>A different approach is needed from the one currently prevalent at the moment. It must place an emphasis on positives as much as on negatives, and on opportunities rather than on self-induced deprivations. I would set out its main principles as follows. <\/p>\n<p>Incentives must take precedence over all other interventions, including those which are tax-based. &#8216;No punishment for punishment&#8217;s sake&#8217;: in other words, punitive measures should either supply revenue that is spent directly for environmental purposes, or be linked in a visible way with behaviour change \u2013 and preferably both. The drivers of petrol-guzzling vehicles, for example, should face heavy tax duties for the privilege, as heavy as is politically feasible, under &#8216;the polluter pays&#8217; principle. Clear and self-evident options for behaviour management are available: switch to smaller cars or drive less.<\/p>\n<p>The positives must dominate. This isn&#8217;t as difficult as it might sound. Take the issue of making homes more energy efficient. There are several countries in the world that have managed to make major progress in this respect. How have they done so? Not by trying to scare people, but by emphasising the advantages of having homes that are snug, protected against the elements and which also save money. An example comes from Sweden, which was achieved by placing a strong emphasis on what was called &#8216;community, style and comfort&#8217;. <\/p>\n<p>Low-carbon practices or inventions that initially have only limited appeal can be fundamentally important if they set trends, or if they are seen as in some way iconic3. Most initiatives, whether social, economic or technological, are, in the early stages, open only to a small elite. In California, for example, there are long waiting lists for the hydrogen powered Lifecar, although the first models will be extremely expensive. However, investment in such a car will provide the opportunity to see whether the vehicle might have a wider market, and also gives it an avant-garde cachet. This is what happened with the Toyota Prius hybrid car, nearly a million of which have been sold worldwide. It was a vanguard model in the sense that it stimulated other manufacturers to start producing low-emission vehicles, whether hybrid or not. <\/p>\n<p>Most initiatives that have successfully reduced emissions so far have been driven by the motivation to increase energy efficiency, rather than the desire to limit climate change. This observation applies to whole countries as well as to regions, cities and the actions of individuals. People are able to grasp and respond to this perspective more easily than they have done to climate change, with all its surrounding debates and complexities; it is not difficult to present energy efficiency in a positive light. What is at stake, as mentioned earlier, is energy efficiency in the economy as a whole, since efficiency gains in one context are of little or no value if savings made are spent on energy-consuming activities elsewhere. The fundamental problem at the moment is to make clean energy sources competitive with fossil fuel energy sources, whether through public provision of subsidies or through technological advance. Utility companies in the US have been offering electricity generated from wind or solar sources to consumers since the late 1990s. Initially, take-up was very small, since the prices were not competitive. In early 2006 Xcel Energy in Colorado and Austin Energy in Texas offered tariffs below those of the regular energy sources. Austin Energy encouraged its customers to sign up for ten-year energy contracts, and was able to prosper even when the price of electricity dropped. <\/p>\n<p>The role of technology in promoting low-carbon lifestyles is bound to be considerable. Technological innovation rarely determines what people do, since we often react to it in ways in which its initiators did not suspect. Thus, when the telephone was invented in 1876 as a signalling device; no one imagined that it would become so intrinsic to our lives as a medium of talk and conversation4. Yet, at the same time, our lives can change dramatically through such interaction with technology. It is said that we are creatures of habit, and it is often true, especially if habits become addictive. Yet this is far from always the case \u2013 we can change our behaviour quite rapidly and dramatically, as has happened, and on a global level, with the arrival of the Internet.<\/p>\n<p>Government should be actively encouraging the creative economy and the creative society, even when these don&#8217;t seem to have an immediate bearing upon climate change, since creativity has to be the order of the day. Richard Florida, who has written extensively on the subject, argues persuasively that the creative sectors of the economy \u2013 where innovation, lateral thinking and enterprise can flourish \u2013 are increasingly becoming the driving force of the economy as a whole. Florida rejects the idea that creativity \u2013 the capacity to innovate, to question conventional wisdom \u2013 is limited to the few. Creativity is a &#8216;limitless resource&#8230;. It&#8217;s a trait that can&#8217;t be handed down, and it can&#8217;t be owned in the traditional sense.&#8217;5 R&#038;D investment is important, but in pioneering responses to climate change, we need to be bringing science, the universities and social entrepreneurs closer together. <\/p>\n<p>Step changes or &#8216;tipping points&#8217; aren&#8217;t confined to the field of climate change science. They apply to social and economic life too \u2013 that was the context, in fact, in which the author who popularised the term, Malcolm Gladwell, originally discussed it6. We should be looking to create tipping points when it comes to the transition to low-carbon lifestyles. From small beginnings, much larger changes can occur when a certain threshold is reached. <\/p>\n<p>Governments have an important role in &#8216;editing choice&#8217;, and, in pursuing that aim, they shouldn&#8217;t be afraid to take on big business when it is necessary to do so. Corporations influence our choices in many direct and indirect ways \u2013 the state shouldn&#8217;t be reluctant to take a leaf out of their book. For instance, supermarkets usually place sweets and chocolates close to the exit, where customers line up to pay for their purchases. The reason is that at that point they are open to impulse buying, having relaxed after making their main purchases. Given the advance of obesity, I see no reason why such a practice shouldn&#8217;t be either prohibited or actively discouraged (although thus far it has not). How far we should go with choices that affect carbon consumption is a moot point. Some examples of choice editing appear to be completely unobjectionable. We could, for example, we could propose that heating and air conditioning should be organised in such a way that everyone knows immediately how much they are spending at any given time. The effect would be even more powerful if we knew how our expenditure rated compared to that of our neighbours. A study showed that heavy users made bigger cuts in consumption if a smiling face was inscribed on bills below the average, with a frowning face on the bills of those having higher than average expenditure. Other examples are more complicated. I see no civil liberties issue in cases where our behaviour is being significantly influenced, or manipulated, already by companies, and where the object of government policy is to counter that influence7. <\/p>\n<p>Technologies and Climate Change<br \/>\nAmbitious attempts have been made to anticipate how the spread of renewable technologies will transform modern economies. Some speak of the coming of a new industrial revolution, which will be initiated by such technologies. The American political thinker Jeremy Rifkin argues that the great changes in world history have taken place when new sources of energy have emerged in tandem with developments in communications. The convergence of coal-based power and the printing press gave rise to the first industrial revolution. Previous forms of communication would not have been able to handle the social and economic complexities introduced by the new forms of technology. The &#8216;second industrial revolution&#8217; started in the late nineteenth century. It was marked by the invention of electric communication, beginning with the telegraph and branching out into the telephone, radio and television. These developments converged with the emergence of oil as a major form of power generation and as the dominant source of energy for transport. <\/p>\n<p>We now stand on the verge of a &#8216;third industrial revolution&#8217;, Rifkin says, which will have as its backdrop the development of networked communication, represented by personal computers and the Internet. The potential of these technologies lies in their convergence with renewable energy. We can envisage a global energy economy where millions of people produce renewable energy and share it with others through national and international power grids \u2013 as happens today with information. Just as personal computers have vastly more power than the early machines, which took up several rooms, so intelligent energy networks will become more powerful and ubiquitous than anything we know at the moment. <\/p>\n<p>Rifkin has his favourite renewable energy source to help point the way ahead: hydrogen8. Hydrogen, he says, is the &#8216;forever fuel&#8217;, since it is the most ubiquitous element in the universe \u2013 and it produces no greenhouse gas emissions. Fuel cells using hydrogen are already being introduced into the market for home and industrial use. The top-down energy regime that exists today with the emphasis on oil and gas will be replaced by decentralised energy production and use. It will be &#8216;the first truly democratic energy regime in history&#8217;9.<\/p>\n<p>Such ideas aren&#8217;t particularly compelling. In the first place, they reflect a view in which history is driven in large part by technology, a partial notion at best. The dating and nature of the supposed second industrial revolution are vague \u2013 as can be seen by the fact that other authors who propose similar ideas come up with quite different versions of when it happened and what its content was. Some, for example, date it 40 or 50 years later than Rifkin does. No one knows as yet what role a specific energy source such as hydrogen might play. Moreover, technologies never operate on their own \u2013 they are always embedded in wider political, economic and social frameworks, which are likely to govern both how they develop and what their consequences are. <\/p>\n<p>In addition, the &#8216;next industrial revolution&#8217; hasn&#8217;t as yet actually happened. The original industrial revolution did not occur in a conscious way. The next one, however, has to be created as a deliberate project to protect us against future dangers \u2013 a very different situation. We don&#8217;t know how things will turn out. It could be, as Rifkin hopes, that energy and politics will march in line \u2013 decentralised network systems, rooted in communities, will replace current forms of political and economic power. It is the vision that many in the green movement would like to see realised. I&#8217;m not sure such an outcome is either likely or desirable. Certainly, it is very possible that most households will help create energy, rather than just consume it \u2013 as is already the case, for example, with feed-in tariffs. However, we will also need coordinated energy management on a national as well as an international level. <\/p>\n<p>Technological innovation has to be a core part of any successful climate change strategy and the same is true of energy policy. The state and government must have a significant role in making such innovation possible, since a regulatory framework, including incentives and other tax mechanisms, will be involved. What role should this be exactly? The issue overlaps with that of planning. For a while, it became conventional wisdom that markets cannot be second-guessed. Nor can we predict with any precision where innovation will happen. Today the pendulum is swinging back again. Various technologies or non-fossil-fuel energy sources are touted as the answer to our need to reduce emissions; large amounts of investment are flowing into them. People are again placing bets on the future.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"<p>This text consists of edited extracts from A.

A great deal of energy is expended in promoting their significance for the construction of a better world. But for the most part the concepts circulating do not fundamentally challenge hegemonic liberal and neo-liberal market logics, or the dominant modes of legality and state action. We live, after all, in a world in which the rights of private property and the profit rate trump all other notions of rights. I here want to explore another type of human right, that of the right to the city.<\/p>\n<p>Has the astonishing pace and scale of urbanisation over the last hundred years contributed to human well-being? The city, in the words of urban sociologist Robert Park, is:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>man\u2019s most successful attempt to remake the world he lives in more after his heart\u2019s desire. But, if the city is the world which man created, it is the world in which he is henceforth condemned to live. Thus, indirectly, and without any clear sense of the nature of his task, in making the city man has remade himself.<sup>1<\/sup><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The question of what kind of city we want cannot be divorced from that of what kind of social ties, relationship to nature, lifestyles, technologies and aesthetic values we desire. The right to the city is far more than the individual liberty to access urban resources: it is a right to change ourselves by changing the city. It is, moreover, a common rather than an individual right since this transformation inevitably depends upon the exercise of a collective power to reshape the processes of urbanisation. The freedom to make and remake our cities and ourselves is, I want to argue, one of the most precious yet most neglected of our human rights.<\/p>\n<p>From their inception, cities have arisen through geographical and social concentrations of a surplus product. Urbanisation has always been, therefore, a class phenomenon, since surpluses are extracted from somewhere and from somebody, while the control over their disbursement typically lies in a few hands. This general situation persists under capitalism, of course; but since urbanisation depends on the mobilisation of a surplus product, an intimate connection emerges between the development of capitalism and urbanisation. Capitalists have to produce a surplus product in order to produce surplus value; this in turn must be reinvested in order to generate more surplus value. The result of continued reinvestment is the expansion of surplus production at a compound rate \u2013 hence the logistic curves (money, output and population) attached to the history of capital accumulation, paralleled by the growth path of urbanisation under capitalism.<\/p>\n<p>The perpetual need to find profitable terrains for capital-surplus production and absorption shapes the politics of capitalism. It also presents the capitalist with a number of barriers to continuous and trouble-free expansion. If labour is scarce and wages are high, either existing labour has to be disciplined \u2013 technologically induced unemployment or an assault on organised working-class power are two prime methods \u2013 or fresh labour forces must be found by immigration, export of capital or proletarianisation of hitherto independent elements of the population. Capitalists must also discover new means of production in general and natural resources in particular, which puts increasing pressure on the natural environment to yield up necessary raw materials and absorb the inevitable waste. They need to open up terrains for raw-material extraction \u2013 often the objective of imperialist and neo-colonial endeavours.<\/p>\n<p>The coercive laws of competition also force the continuous implementation of new technologies and organisational forms, since these enable capitalists to out-compete those using inferior methods. Innovations define new wants and needs, reduce the turnover time of capital and lessen the friction of distance, which limits the geographical range within which the capitalist can search for expanded labour supplies, raw materials, and so on. If there is not enough purchasing power in the market, then new markets must be found by expanding foreign trade, promoting novel products and lifestyles, creating new credit instruments, and debt-financing state and private expenditures. If, finally, the profit rate is too low, then state regulation of \u2018ruinous competition\u2019, monopolisation (mergers and acquisitions) and capital exports provide ways out.<\/p>\n<p>If any of the above barriers cannot be circumvented, capitalists are unable profitably to reinvest their surplus product. Capital accumulation is blocked, leaving them facing a crisis, in which their capital can be devalued and in some instances even physically wiped out. Surplus commodities can lose value or be destroyed, while productive capacity and assets can be written down and left unused; money itself can be devalued through inflation, and labour through massive unemployment. How, then, has the need to circumvent these barriers and to expand the terrain of profitable activity driven capitalist urbanisation? I argue here that urbanisation has played a particularly active role, alongside such phenomena as military expenditures, in absorbing the surplus product that capitalists perpetually produce in their search for profits.<br \/>\n[\u2026]<\/p>\n<h2>Property and pacification<\/h2>\n<p>As in all the preceding phases, this most recent radical expansion of the urban process has brought with it incredible transformations of lifestyle. Quality of urban life has become a commodity, as has the city itself, in a world where consumerism, tourism, cultural and knowledge-based industries have become major aspects of the urban political economy. The postmodernist penchant for encouraging the formation of market niches \u2013 in both consumer habits and cultural forms \u2013 surrounds the contemporary urban experience with an aura of freedom of choice, provided you have the money. Shopping malls, multiplexes and box stores proliferate, as do fast-food and artisanal market-places. We now have, as urban sociologist Sharon Zukin puts it, \u2018pacification by cappuccino\u2019. Even the incoherent, bland and monotonous suburban tract development that continues to dominate in many areas now gets its antidote in a \u2018new urbanism\u2019 movement that touts the sale of community and boutique lifestyles to fulfil urban dreams. This is a world in which the neo-liberal ethic of intense possessive individualism, and its cognate of political withdrawal from collective forms of action, becomes the template for human socialisation.<sup>2<\/sup> The defence of property values becomes of such paramount political interest that, as Mike Davis points out, the homeowner associations in the state of California become bastions of political reaction, if not of fragmented neighbourhood fascisms.<sup>3<\/sup><\/p>\n<p>We increasingly live in divided and conflict-prone urban areas. In the past three decades, the neo-liberal turn has restored class power to rich elites. Fourteen billionaires have emerged in Mexico since then, and in 2006 that country boasted the richest man on earth, Carlos Slim, at the same time as the incomes of the poor had either stagnated or diminished. The results are indelibly etched on the spatial forms of our cities, which increasingly consist of fortified fragments, gated communities and privatised public spaces kept under constant surveillance. In the developing world in particular, the city is splitting into different separated parts, with the apparent formation of many \u2018micro-states\u2019. Wealthy neighbourhoods provided with all kinds of services, such as exclusive schools, golf courses, tennis courts and private police patrolling the area around the clock intertwine with illegal settlements where water is available only at public fountains, no sanitation system exists, electricity is pirated by a privileged few, the roads become mud streams whenever it rains, and where house-sharing is the norm. Each fragment appears to live and function autonomously, sticking firmly to what it has been able to grab in the daily fight for survival.<sup>4<\/sup><\/p>\n<p>Under these conditions, ideals of urban identity, citizenship and belonging \u2013 already threatened by the spreading malaise of a neo-liberal ethic \u2013 become much harder to sustain. Privatised redistribution through criminal activity threatens individual security at every turn, prompting popular demands for police suppression. Even the idea that the city might function as a collective body politic, a site within and from which progressive social movements might emanate, appears implausible. There are, however, urban social movements seeking to overcome isolation and reshape the city in a different image from that put forward by the developers, who are backed by finance, corporate capital and an increasingly entrepreneurially minded local state apparatus.<\/p>\n<h2>Dispossessions<\/h2>\n<p>Surplus absorption through urban transformation has an even darker aspect. It has entailed repeated bouts of urban restructuring through \u2018creative destruction\u2019, which nearly always has a class dimension since it is the poor, the underprivileged and those marginalised from political power that suffer first and foremost from this process. Violence is required to build the new urban world on the wreckage of the old. Haussmann tore through the old Parisian slums, using powers of expropriation in the name of civic improvement and renovation. He deliberately engineered the removal of much of the working class and other unruly elements from the city centre, where they constituted a threat to public order and political power. He created an urban form where it was believed \u2013 incorrectly, as it turned out in 1871 \u2013 that sufficient levels of surveillance and military control could be attained to ensure that revolutionary movements would easily be brought to heel. Nevertheless, as Engels pointed out in 1872:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>In reality, the bourgeoisie has only one method of solving the housing question after its fashion \u2013 that is to say, of solving it in such a way that the solution continually reproduces the question anew. This method is called \u2018Haussmann\u2019\u2026 No matter how different the reasons may be, the result is always the same; the scandalous alleys and lanes disappear to the accompaniment of lavish self-praise from the bourgeoisie on account of this tremendous success, but they appear again immediately somewhere else\u2026 The same economic necessity which produced them in the first place, produces them in the next place.<sup>5<\/sup><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>It took more than a hundred years to complete the embourgeoisement of central Paris, with the consequences seen in recent years of uprisings and mayhem in those isolated suburbs that trap marginalised immigrants, unemployed workers and youth. The sad point here, of course, is that what Engels described recurs throughout history. Robert Moses \u2018took a meat axe to the Bronx\u2019, in his infamous words, bringing forth long and loud laments from neighbourhood groups and movements. In the cases of Paris and New York, once the power of state expropriations had been successfully resisted and contained, a more insidious and cancerous progression took hold through municipal fiscal discipline, property speculation and the sorting of land-use according to the rate of return for its \u2018highest and best use\u2019. Engels understood this sequence all too well:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The growth of the big modern cities gives the land in certain areas, particularly in those areas which are centrally situated, an artificially and colossally increasing value; the buildings erected on these areas depress this value instead of increasing it, because they no longer belong to the changed circumstances. They are pulled down and replaced by others. This takes place above all with workers\u2019 houses which are situated centrally and whose rents, even with the greatest overcrowding, can never, or only very slowly, increase above a certain maximum. They are pulled down and in their stead shops, warehouses and public buildings are erected.<sup>6<\/sup><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Though this description was written in 1872, it applies directly to contemporary urban development in much of Asia \u2013 Delhi, Seoul, Mumbai \u2013 as well as gentrification in New York. A process of displacement and what I call \u2018accumulation by dispossession\u2019 lie at the core of urbanisation under capitalism.7 It is the mirror image of capital absorption through urban redevelopment, and is giving rise to numerous conflicts over the capture of valuable land from low-income populations that may have lived there for many years.<\/p>\n<p>Consider the case of Seoul in the 1990s: construction companies and developers hired goon squads of sumo-wrestler types to invade neighbourhoods on the city\u2019s hillsides. They sledgehammered down not only housing but also all the possessions of those who had built their own homes in the 1950s on what had become premium land. High-rise towers, which show no trace of the brutality that permitted their construction, now cover most of those hillsides. In Mumbai, meanwhile, 6 million people officially considered as slum dwellers are settled on land without legal title; all maps of the city leave these places blank. With the attempt to turn Mumbai into a global financial centre to rival Shanghai, the property-development boom has gathered pace, and the land that squatters occupy appears increasingly valuable. Dharavi, one of the most prominent slums in Mumbai, is estimated to be worth US$2 billion. The pressure to clear it \u2013\u00a0for environmental and social reasons that mask the land grab \u2013 is mounting daily. Financial powers backed by the state push for forcible slum clearance, in some cases violently taking possession of terrain occupied for a whole generation. Capital accumulation through real-estate activity booms, since the land is acquired at almost no cost.<\/p>\n<p>Will the people who are displaced get compensation? The lucky ones get a bit. But while the Indian Constitution specifies that the state has an obligation to protect the lives and well-being of the whole population, irrespective of caste or class, and to guarantee rights to housing and shelter, the Supreme Court has issued judgements that rewrite this constitutional requirement. Since slum dwellers are illegal occupants and many cannot definitively prove their long-term residence, they have no right to compensation. To concede that right, says the Supreme Court, would be tantamount to rewarding pickpockets for their actions. So the squatters either resist and fight, or move with their few belongings to camp out on the sides of motorways or wherever they can find a tiny space.<sup>8<\/sup> Examples of dispossession can also be found in the US, though these tend to be less brutal and more legalistic: the government\u2019s right of eminent domain has been abused in order to displace established residents in reasonable housing in favour of higher-order land uses, such as condominiums and box stores. When this was challenged in the US Supreme Court, the justices ruled that it was constitutional for local jurisdictions to behave in this way in order to increase their property-tax base.<sup>9<\/sup><\/p>\n<p>In China millions are being dispossessed of the spaces they have long occupied \u2013 three million in Beijing alone. Since they lack private-property rights, the state can simply remove them by fiat, offering a minor cash payment to help them on their way before turning the land over to developers at a large profit. In some instances, people move willingly, but there are also reports of widespread resistance, the usual response to which is brutal repression by the Communist party. In the PRC it is often populations on the rural margins who are displaced, illustrating the significance of Henri Lefebvre\u2019s argument, presciently laid out in the 1960s, that the clear distinction that once existed between the urban and the rural is gradually fading into a set of porous spaces of uneven geographical development, under the hegemonic command of capital and the State. This is also the case in India, where the central and state governments now favour the establishment of Special Economic Zones \u2013 ostensibly for industrial development, though most of the land is designated for urbanisation. This policy has led to pitched battles against agricultural producers, the grossest of which was the massacre at Nandigram in West Bengal in March 2007, orchestrated by the state\u2019s Marxist government. Intent on opening up terrain for the Salim Group, an Indonesian conglomerate, the ruling CPI(M) sent armed police to disperse protesting villagers; at least 14 were shot dead and dozens wounded. Private property rights in this case provided no protection.<\/p>\n<p>What of the seemingly progressive proposal to award private-property rights to squatter populations, providing them with assets that will permit them to leave poverty behind?<sup>10<\/sup> Such a scheme is now being mooted for Rio\u2019s <em>favelas<\/em>, for example. The problem is that the poor, beset with income insecurity and frequent financial difficulties, can easily be persuaded to trade in that asset for a relatively low cash payment. The rich typically refuse to give up their valued assets at any price, which is why Moses could take a meat axe to the low-income Bronx but not to affluent Park Avenue. The lasting effect of Margaret Thatcher\u2019s privatisation of social housing in Britain has been to create a rent and price structure throughout metropolitan London that precludes lower-income and even middle-class people from access to accommodation anywhere near the urban centre. I wager that within fifteen years, if present trends continue, all those hillsides in Rio now occupied by <em>favelas<\/em> will be covered by high-rise condominiums with fabulous views over the idyllic bay, while the erstwhile <em>favela<\/em> dwellers will have been filtered off into some remote periphery.<br \/>\n[\u2026]<\/p>\n<p>We have yet, however, to see a coherent opposition to these developments in the twenty-first century. &#8230; At this point in history, this has to be a global struggle, predominantly with finance capital, for that is the scale at which urbanisation processes now work. To be sure, the political task of organising such a confrontation is difficult, if not daunting. However, the opportunities are multiple because, as this brief history shows, crises repeatedly erupt around urbanisation both locally and globally, and because the metropolis is now the point of massive collision \u2013 dare we call it class struggle? \u2013 over the accumulation by dispossession visited upon the least well-off and the developmental drive that seeks to colonise space for the affluent.<\/p>\n<p>One step towards unifying these struggles is to adopt the right to the city as both working slogan and political ideal, precisely because it focuses on the question of who commands the necessary connection between urbanisation and surplus production and use. The democratisation of that right, and the construction of a broad social movement to enforce its will is imperative if the dispossessed are to take back the control which they have for so long been denied, and if they are to institute new modes of urbanisation. Lefebvre was right to insist that the revolution has to be urban, in the broadest sense of that term, or nothing at all.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"<p>This is an abridged version of a text that was originally published in the New Left Review, September\u2013October 2008.

Over the next 72 hours the government shut down the country\u2019s Internet service and mobile phone system in an attempt to squelch the rebellion. To no avail: a rich ecosystem of Facebook conversations, Twitter outbursts and chat room plans had already unified millions of Cairo\u2019s people, who continued the relentless uprising. The government backed down and restored communications to keep the country\u2019s economy on life support, but the masses kept up the pressure until Mubarak resigned two weeks later. <\/p>\n<p>Just weeks before, during Tunisia\u2019s \u2018Dignity Revolution\u2019, dissident blogger and protest organiser Slim Amamou used the mobile social app Foursquare to alert his friends of his 6 January arrest. By \u2018checking in\u2019 at Foursquare\u2019s virtual depiction of the prison in Tunis where he was being held, Amamou revealed his location to a global web of supporters and immediately grabbed the international spotlight. The news stories sparked further uprisings, and long-time president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali was soon ousted. <\/p>\n<p>Across the archipelago of places where the \u2018Arab Spring\u2019 revolts played out, citizens used new Internet applications and ubiquitous mobile phones to wage a battle over the soul of their cities, shifting resources back and forth, from cyberspace to \u2018cityspace\u2019. Contrast those transformations with a handful of large urban development projects that have been vying to be crowned the model \u2018smart city\u2019 of the future. Furthest along are the comprehensively pre-planned, walled community of 50,000, Masdar, outside Abu Dhabi, Songdo City in South Korea, and PlanIT Valley in Portugal, where experiments to determine how future cities will be built are carried out by governments, real estate developers, ICT companies, and designers. <\/p>\n<p>But as models, these top-down projects pale in comparison to the emergent form of intelligence that is bubbling up from millions of newly cyber-connected residents. Truly smart \u2013 and real \u2013 cities are not like an army regiment marching in lockstep to the commander\u2019s orders; they are more like a shifting flock of birds or shoal of fish, in which individuals respond to subtle social and behavioural cues from their neighbours about which way to move forward. Although the mobs in Cairo and Tunis appeared unruly, their actions resulted from digital coordination of human activity on an unprecedented scale. Hundreds of thousands of people appeared in Tahrir Square in Cairo because text messages and tweets summoned them \u2013 reflecting an immensely powerful, democratic and organic alternative vision of the smart city. <\/p>\n<p>Rather than focusing on the installation and control of network hardware, city governments, technology companies and their urban planning advisers can exploit a more ground-up approach to creating even smarter cities, in which people become the agents of change. With proper technical support structures, the populace can tackle problems such as energy use, traffic congestion, health care and education more effectively than centralised dictates can. And residents of wired cities can use their distributed intelligence to fashion new community activities, as well as a new kind of citizen activism. <\/p>\n<h1>Going beyond urban efficiency<\/h1>\n<p>Why are countries racing so haphazardly to implement smart cities? Why is IBM forecasting US$10 billion of revenue in its Smarter Planet initiative by 2015? What is happening at an urban scale today is similar to what happened two decades ago in Formula One. Up to that point, success on the circuit was primarily credited to a car\u2019s mechanics and the driver\u2019s capabilities. But then telemetry technology blossomed. The car was transformed into a computer that was monitored in real time by thousands of sensors, becoming \u2018intelligent\u2019 and better able to respond to the specific conditions of the race. <\/p>\n<p>In a similar way, over the past decade digital technologies have begun to blanket our cities, forming the backbone of a large, intelligent infrastructure. Broadband fibre optic and wireless telecommunications grids are supporting mobile phones, smartphones and tablets that are increasingly affordable. At the same time, open databases \u2013 especially from the government \u2013 that people can read and add to are revealing all kinds of information, and public kiosks and displays are helping both literate and illiterate people to access them. Add to this foundation a relentlessly growing network of sensors and digital-control technologies, all tied together by cheap, powerful computers, and our cities are quickly becoming like \u2018computers in the open air\u2019. <\/p>\n<p>The vast amount of data that is emerging is the starting point for making efficient infrastructure programmable so that people can optimise a city\u2019s daily processes. Extracting information about real-time road conditions, for example, can reduce traffic and improve air quality. In Stockholm\u2019s road-pricing scheme, cameras automatically identify licence plates of vehicles entering the city centre and charge drivers\u2019 accounts up to SEK60 (US$9, \u20ac7) a day, depending on where the cars go. The system has shortened the waiting time for vehicles traversing the central district by up to 50 per cent and has reduced pollutant emissions by up to 15 per cent. Similar technologies can help bring down water use (one example is being used by the Sonoma County Water Agency in California) and provide better services to citizens. <\/p>\n<h1>Building from the Bottom Up<\/h1>\n<p>If we focus on sociability as the starting point for design and tapping into citizens as the source of innovation, how do we go about crafting a smarter city? <\/p>\n<p>An ideal beginning is to leverage the growing array of smart personal devices we all wield and recruit people as the sensors of a city, rather than relying only on formal systems embedded into infrastructure. The traffic function on Google Maps is a good example. Instead of building a costly network of dedicated vehicle sensors along roads, Google constantly polls a large network of anonymous volunteers whose mobile devices report their up-to-the-minute status, which reveals where traffic is flowing, has slowed or stopped. The information is delivered to drivers via mobile mapping applications in various ways: as coloured overlays indicating traffic speeds, as estimated driving times that account for delays, or as a factor in determining alternative routes. These handy data allow users to see the circulatory network of the city in real time and understand the constantly changing cost in time of getting from point A to point B. Although Google is certainly not a grassroots platform, this example shows how peer-to-peer sharing of sensory data can have a huge impact in helping to manage urban infrastructure. This scenario also shows how smart cities can be both sociable and more efficient without imposing order from above; you choose the best route based on your peers\u2019 observations instead of being directed by traffic engineers. <\/p>\n<p>Google\u2019s traffic app leverages a large base of existing consumer devices. But bottom-up approaches to sensing can also provide rapid, cheap deployment of new kinds of sensors that measure and record data about people\u2019s activities, movements, surroundings and health. As recently as 2009, Paris had fewer than a dozen ozone monitoring stations. To greatly expand this official data stream, the Green Watch project, overseen by Internet think tank Fing, distributed 200 smart devices to Parisians. The devices sensed ozone and noise levels as their wearers went about their daily lives, and the ongoing measurements were shared publicly through the Citypulse mapping engine. In the first trial, more than 130,000 measurements were taken in a single city district. The experiment showed how a grassroots sensory network could be deployed almost in an instant \u2013 at dramatically lower costs than expanding the city\u2019s archaic fixed stations. The project also showed that citizens could become deeply engaged in environmental monitoring and regulation. Ultimately, sensors for grassroots networks will be built into everyday objects: phones, vehicles and clothing. <\/p>\n<p>Bottom-up approaches are also leveraging the sociability of cities to change patterns of activity. As the booming popularity of local shopping networks such as Groupon and LivingSocial shows, connecting local businesses and city dwellers through mobile social networks is a powerful catalyst for action. These new ways of scripting the city can create more lasting kinds of social touch points, too. The Foursquare mobile social network that Amamou used in Tunis can also turn going out into a kind of mobile game. It crowns the most frequent visitor to every cafe, bar and restaurant as the \u2018mayor\u2019 \u2013 a reference to the \u2018self-appointed public characters\u2019 described in 1961 by urbanist Jane Jacobs in <em>The Death and Life of Great American Cities<\/em>. Like the corner gossips that Jacobs argued were so critical to neighbourhood cohesion and safe streets, Foursquare\u2019s mayors remind us that even the most intelligent of digital cities are vital because they are filled with interesting and accessible people.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"<p>This article is partially based on Carlo Ratti &#038; Anthony Townsend, 2011, The Social Nexus, Scientific American (305), pp. 42-48.<\/p>\n","pdf_uri":"","article_publishing_date":"December 2012","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"293","name":"Carlo","created":"2012-11-27 19:57:08","modified":"2012-11-27 19:57:08","slug":"ratti-carlo","family_name":"Ratti","title":"","email_address":"","photo_legacy":"","profile_text":"","organization":"","role":"","additional_affiliations":"","qualifications":"","staff_pages_blurb":"","office_location":"","display_after":"","display_until":"","extended_blurb":"","special_2012ec_blurb":"<p>Carlo Ratti, an architect and engineer by training, practices in Italy and teaches at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he directs the Senseable City Lab.

The reality consists of a vast number of highly particular global circuits: some are specialised and some are worldwide while others are regional. Different circuits contain different groups of countries and cities. For instance, Mumbai is today part of a global circuit for real estate development that includes firms from cities as diverse as London and Bogot\u00e1. Global commodity trading in coffee includes New York and S\u00e3o Paulo as major hubs. Buenos Aires is on a global commodity trading circuit that includes Chicago and Mumbai. Globally traded commodities \u2013 gold, butter, coffee, oil, sunflower seeds \u2013 are redistributed to a vast number of destinations, no matter how few the points of origin are in some cases. And the current collapse of major financial institutions involves particular sets of global circuits and hence does not affect all global cities in the same way.<\/p>\n<p>Top Places for Business in Latin America<br \/> <img src=\"http:\/\/www.urban-age.net\/0_images\/02_SA08Ref_Sassen2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"396\" height=\"584\" border=\"0\" \/><br \/> This list ranks \u2018urban competitiveness\u2019 as measured by a composite of indicators that compare each Latin American city\u2019s capacity to attract and keep companies doing business in their city. It was prepared by America Economia and analyses each city\u2019s economic structures, geo-strategic advantages, service industries available for businesses, intellectual and human capital and services for executives.<\/p>\n<p>Not only global economic forces feed this proliferation of circuits. Migration, cultural work, and civil society\u2019s struggle to preserve human rights, the environment, and social justice, also feed the formation and development of global circuits. Thus NGOs fighting for the protection of the rainforest function in circuits that include Brazil and Indonesia, the global media centres of New York and London, and the places where the major forestry companies and the main buyers of wood are headquartered, cities as diverse as Oslo, London and Tokyo. The other side of all these trends is an increasing urbanising of global networks.<\/p>\n<p>Adopting the perspective of one of these cities reveals the diversity and specificity of its location on some, or many, of these circuits. These emergent inter-city geographies begin to function as an infrastructure for multiple forms of globalisation. The first step is to identify the specific global circuits on which a city is located. These will vary from city to city, depending on a city\u2019s particular strengths, just as the groupings of cities vary on each circuit. All of this also shows us that the specialised differences of cities matter, and that there is less competition among cities and more of a global or regional division of functions than is commonly recognised.<\/p>\n<p>For example, the knowledge economies of S\u00e3o Paulo, Chicago and Shanghai all share a long history of servicing major heavy manufacturing sectors. Theirs are economic histories that global cities such as New York and London never developed. Out of these specialised differences comes a global division of functions. Thus a steel factory, a mining firm, or a machine manufacturer that wants to go global will go to S\u00e3o Paulo, Shanghai or Chicago for its legal, accounting, financial, insurance, economic forecasting, and other such specialised services. It will not go to New York or London for this highly particular servicing.<\/p>\n<p>Recognising the value of the specialised differences of cities and urban regions in today\u2019s global economy shows how the deep economic history of a place matters for the type of knowledge economy that a city or a city-region ends up developing. This goes against the common view that globalisation homogenises economies. How much this deep economic history matters varies, and partly depends on the particulars of a city\u2019s or a region\u2019s economy. It matters more than is commonly assumed, and it matters in ways that are not generally recognised. Globalisation homogenises standards \u2013 for managing, for accounting, for building state-of-the-art office districts, and so on. But it needs diverse specialised economic capabilities.<\/p>\n<p>The capabilities needed to trade, finance, service, and invest globally need to be generated. They are not simply a by-product of the power of multinational firms and telecommunications advances. The global city is a platform for producing these types of global capabilities, even when this requires large numbers of foreign firms, as is the case in cities as diverse as Beijing and Buenos Aires. Each of the 70 plus major and minor global cities in the world contributes to the production of these capabilities in its home country, and thereby functions as a bridge between its national economy and the global economy. In this networked multi-city geography, most of the 250,000 plus multinational corporations in the world have kept their headquarters in their home countries, no matter the vast numbers of affiliates, subsidiaries or offshore sourcing sites they may have around the globe. So have Latin American multinationals with expanding global regional and global operations. Brazil\u2019s over 1,200 multinational firms, the single highest concentration in the region, have basically kept their headquarters at home, with a strong concentration in S\u00e3o Paulo.<\/p>\n<p>Within a vast and diverse region such as Latin America it has now become clear that several cities function as key hubs, each representing a distinctive mix of strengths. In a top tier we find S\u00e3o Paulo, Mexico City and Santiago, and in a second tier Buenos Aires, Bogot\u00e1, Caracas, Montevideo, Monterrey, Quito and Lima. Finally, there is a global Latin American space economy that includes cities outside the geographic region: Miami and Madrid are prominent in this space. For instance, the 20 major banks headquartered in Central America have about 200 correspondent links with Miami, compared to 35 with New York. In a comprehensive survey asking businesses in Latin America what is the best city to do business in Latin America, America Economia found that Miami appeared regularly in the answers.<\/p>\n<p>The other side of this dynamic is that for a firm to go global it has to put down its feet in multiple cities that function as entry points into national economies. This bridging capacity is critical: the multiple circuits connecting major and minor global cities are the live infrastructure of the global economy. It indicates that cities do not simply compete with each other. A global firm does not want one global city, even if it is the best in the world. Different groups of cities will be desirable, even if they have some serious negatives. This helps explain why there is no one \u2018perfect\u2019 global city. Today\u2019s global phase does not function through one imperial global capital that has it all.<\/p>\n<p>A large study by MasterCard of 75 cities rates the top cities for worldwide commerce. Not one of them ranks at the top in all of the 100 factors, and not one gets the perfect score. London and New York, the two leading global cities, rank low in several aspects \u2013 neither is in the top ten when it comes to starting a business, or closing a business. If we consider a critical variable in the \u2018ease of doing business\u2019 indicator, part of which is \u2018ease of entry and exit\u2019, London ranks 43rd and New York ranks 56th. Perhaps most surprising, London ranks 37th on \u2018contract enforcement\u2019 and 21st on \u2018investor protection\u2019. It is Singapore that ranks number one in relation to all three variables. Less surprising is that New York ranks 34th on one of the data points for \u2018livability\u2019: health and safety. In the global South, cities like Mumbai and S\u00e3o Paulo are in the top group for financial and economic services, but are brought down in their overall score by their low rankings in factors related to the ease of doing business and livability, given their especially low levels of well-being for vast sectors of the population.<\/p>\n<p>Overall, S\u00e3o Paulo is in a middle-ranked group of about 20 cities framed at the top by Dubai and at the bottom by Shenzhen. The group includes some of the most powerful in the world. Furthermore, it is a power based on multiple and various conditions: cities as diverse as Beijing, Mumbai, Tel Aviv, Moscow, Johannesburg and Kuala Lumpur. This group ranks between Dubai\u2019s 44th place with an overall score of 47, and Shenzhen\u2019s 60th place with an overall score of 40. The scores for the top two cities are 79 for London and 72 for New York; further down, Amsterdam\u2019s score is 60 followed by Madrid at 59, respectively the 10th and 11th ranked global cities in the world for commerce.<\/p>\n<p>Some of S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s lowest rankings are in macro-economic variables, such as \u2018political and legal framework\u2019 and \u2018economic stability\u2019. Cities at similar levels on these two indicators within South America are Bogot\u00e1, Caracas, and Buenos Aires, and, outside of South America, Johannesburg, Mumbai, Moscow, Budapest and Istanbul. Sub-indicators such as \u2018dealing with licenses\u2019 and \u2018registering property\u2019, where the city\u2019s implementation of national regulations and laws can make a difference, point to a considerable variability in performance. S\u00e3o Paulo does not do better than in the basic macro-economic variables such as inflation. But Bogot\u00e1, Buenos Aires and Caracas all do much better on these two sub-indicators than they do on purely macro- economic variables, pointing to more successful implementation. This negative urban performance also comes through on the indicator measuring the \u2018ease of doing business\u2019. S\u00e3o Paulo ranks considerably below its overall ranking in the global set of 75 cities. With Dubai it is just the inverse: on \u2018ease of doing business\u2019 it does much better than its overall ranking. When disaggregated into sub-indicators, S\u00e3o Paulo is below its overall rank on \u2018starting a business\u2019, \u2018employing workers\u2019, \u2018closing a business\u2019, \u2018banking services\u2019 and \u2018contract enforcement\u2019. S\u00e3o Paulo ranks well above its overall score on \u2018investor protection\u2019, \u2018getting credit\u2019, and \u2018ease of entry and exit\u2019 \u2013 though on this last one Caracas does even better.<\/p>\n<p>S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s ranking of 16 on the \u2018financial centre\u2019 indicator sits sharply above its overall ranking, putting it in the top echelon of the global economy; Santiago, Mexico City, Buenos Aires and Bogot\u00e1 also rank much higher on the \u2018financial centre\u2019 indicator than they do overall. The sharpest differentials are for S\u00e3o Paulo and Buenos Aires. On some of the sub-indicators S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s rank jumps to the top ten: \u2018total number of derivatives contracts\u2019 at 7, and \u2018total number of commodities contracts\u2019 at 9. It ranks 12th globally in its \u2018banking and financial services companies\u2019, 20th in \u2018investment and securities firms\u2019, 23rd in \u2018equities trading\u2019. Its lowest score on the financial dimension is 39th on \u2018insurance companies\u2019, which is still well above its overall rank. Similarly, Buenos Aires is in the top 20 for particular financial circuits \u2013 14th in the number of \u2018commodities contracts\u2019 and 15th in the \u2018value of bond trading\u2019.<\/p>\n<p>Clearly S\u00e3o Paulo is one of the major global financial centres in the world. Its overall score of 34.92 may not make that immediately evident. But the top-ranked financial centres are also well below the perfect score of 100: London has a score of 67.44, New York 54.60, Frankfurt 46.73, Seoul sits at 52.76, and Chicago 40.52 while Dubai is valued at 24.74, Atlanta at 8, and Edinburgh at 2. These \u2018financial centre\u2019 indicator scores are partly a function of a) the enormous weight of the major centres and b) the fact of multiple specialised types of financial circuits (equities, commodities, derivatives, bonds). This leaves even significant centres such as Dubai and Edinburgh with a very low relative score which can nonetheless override the fact that Dubai, for instance, ranks number one in \u2018banking services\u2019 along with most of the top 20 centres, except for Chicago at 41, as it has lost all its major banks, Seoul at 57 and Tokyo at 23.<\/p>\n<p>S\u00e3o Paulo gets its second highest indicator ranking, at 26 as a business centre. Its highest score is for \u2018volume of commercial real estate development\u2019, placing it 4th, right, below Shenzhen, which has seen a vast building boom. Even so, S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s contrasts among its sub-indicator rankings are sharp, placing it 49th for international airport traffic.<\/p>\n<p>In this growing number of global cities and in their differences we see the larger story of a shift to a multi-polar world. The loss of position of US cities compared with the 2006 survey is part of this shift: Los Angeles dropped from the 10th to the 17th rank, and Boston from 12th to 23rd, while European and Asian cities moved up in the top ranks, notably Madrid going from 17th to 11th. These shifts give added content to the loss of position of the United States as the dominant economic and military power. It is not that the United States is suddenly poorer, it is that other regions of the world are rising and that there are multiple forces feeding these multi-sited economic, political, and cultural strengths.<\/p>\n<p>The recent growth of informal economies in major global cities in North America, Western Europe, and to a lesser extent, Japan, raises a number of questions about what is and what is not part of today\u2019s advanced urban economies. Three trends suggest that much of today\u2019s informalisation is actually linked to key features of advanced urban capitalism. One is the sharp emergence and growth of informal economies in the major global cities of the North. Secondly, the mostly overlooked proliferation of an informal economy of creative professionals \u2013 artists, architects, designers, software developers, event choreographers, etc. working in these cities. Finally, the new types of informalisation of work actually function as the informal equivalent of the formal deregulation in finance, telecommunications and most other advanced economic sectors pursued in the name of \u2018flexibility and innovation\u2019. The difference is that while formal deregulation was costly, and was paid through tax revenue as well as private capital, informalisation is low- cost and sits largely on the backs of workers and informal firms themselves.<\/p>\n<p>This new creative professional informal economy greatly expands opportunities and networking potentials for these artists and professionals to operate at least partly informally. It allows them to function in the interstices of urban and organisational spaces often dominated by large corporate actors and to escape the corporatising of creative work. In this process they contribute a very specific feature of the new urban economy: its innovativeness and a certain type of frontier spirit. We can see it as a reinvention of Jane Jacobs\u2019 urban economic creativity.<\/p>\n<p>Conditions akin to those in global cities of the North may also be producing a new type of informal economy in global cities of the south, including a professional creative informal economy. Their emergence may be far less visible than in the North because they are partly submerged under the old informal economies that continue to operate in the global South, and are still more a result of poverty and survival than of the needs of advanced economic sectors.<\/p>\n<p>In brief, the same politico-economic restructuring that led to the new urban economy emerging in the late 1980s also contributed to the formation of new informal economies. The decline of the manufacturing dominated industrial complex that characterised most of the twentieth century, and the rise of a new, service-dominated economic complex provide the general context within which we need to place informalisation if we are to go beyond a mere description of instances of informal work.<\/p>\n<p>Thus while much has been said about the global economy homogenising national economies, these urban facts actually point in the opposite direction: different cities have different strengths. Global firms and markets, but also cultural enterprises, want many global cities because each of these cities expands the global platform for operations, and because each is a bridge between the global and the particularities of national economies and societies. This also underlines that global cities are built, developed and made.<\/p>\n<p>The rebuilding of central areas that is occurring in all of these cities, whether downtown, at the edges, or in both areas, is part of this new economic role. Rebuilding key parts of these cities as platforms for a rapidly growing range of global activities and flows, from economic to cultural and political also explains why architecture, urban design and urban planning have all become more important and visible in the last two decades. And it explains the growing competition for space in these cities and the emergence of a new type of politics, one centred in the right to the city.<\/p>\n<p>Whether all of this is good or bad for the larger social fabric of these cities and their countries is a complex matter, and the subject of many debates. But the fact that global firms need cities, and indeed groups of cities, should enable the political, corporate and civic leadership in those cities to negotiate for more benefits for their cities from global firms. This could lead to overall positive outcomes if the governing classes can see that these global economic functions will grow better in a context of a strong and prosperous middle class rather than the sharp inequality and polarity that exists among a growing share of households. European global cities have done better than global cities in the United States precisely for this reason.<\/p>\n<p>As was evident at the Urban Age India conference, the trends in the new rising global cities of the South have seen the now familiar trends of the North: the growing numbers of the very rich and of the very poor, along with the expansion of the impoverished old middle classes. What there will be less of in these cities is the modest middle classes and the modest-profit making economic sectors that once were the major presence in these cities: they are critical to the urban economy because they have incomes which are most likely to be fully spent in the city\u2019s economy. Their presence is a built-in resistance to the spatial and social reshaping of cities along extreme class lines. Finally, my most pessimistic scenario is that conflict is now wired into urban space itself, partly due to gentrification and displacement and the resulting politics for space. In some cities, for instance New York and Los Angeles, it takes the form of a diffuse petty criminality and mostly violence of the disadvantaged on the disadvantaged. In other cities, the European ones but also the rising Shanghais, it takes the form of new racisms that can lead to physical violence. And yet in others, perhaps S\u00e3o Paulo or Rio de Janeiro, at its most extreme it takes the form of partial sporadic urban warfare, including warfare in the space of prisons.<\/p>\n<p>In my view we urgently need to innovate on the front of urban governance. The old bureaucratic ways will not do. This is a whole new urban era \u2013with its share of positive potentials and its share of miseries. In cities our governance challenges become concrete and urgent. National states can keep talking; urban leadership needs to act.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Top Cities for worldwide Commerce<br \/> <img src=\"http:\/\/www.urban-age.net\/0_images\/02_SA08Ref_Sassen3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"396\" height=\"421\" border=\"0\" \/><\/strong><br \/> <strong>Financial Centre<br \/> <img src=\"http:\/\/www.urban-age.net\/0_images\/02_SA08Ref_Sassen4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"396\" height=\"399\" border=\"0\" \/><\/strong><br \/> <strong>Livability<br \/> <img src=\"http:\/\/www.urban-age.net\/0_images\/02_SA08Ref_Sassen5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"396\" height=\"475\" border=\"0\" \/><\/strong><strong>Economic Stability<br \/> <img src=\"http:\/\/www.urban-age.net\/0_images\/02_SA08Ref_Sassen6.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"396\" height=\"452\" border=\"0\" \/><\/strong><br \/> <strong>Legal and Political Framework<br \/> <img src=\"http:\/\/www.urban-age.net\/0_images\/02_SA08Ref_Sassen7.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"396\" height=\"452\" border=\"0\" \/><\/strong><br \/> <strong>Ease of Doing Business<br \/> <img src=\"http:\/\/www.urban-age.net\/0_images\/02_SA08Ref_Sassen8.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"396\" height=\"413\" border=\"0\" \/><\/strong><br \/> <strong>Business Centre<br \/> <img src=\"http:\/\/www.urban-age.net\/0_images\/02_SA08Ref_Sassen9.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"396\" height=\"423\" border=\"0\" \/><\/strong><br \/> <strong>Business Centre Sub-Indicator Rankings<br \/> <img src=\"http:\/\/www.urban-age.net\/0_images\/02_SA08Ref_Sassen10.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"396\" height=\"205\" border=\"0\" \/><br \/> <\/strong><\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":"http:\/\/v0.urban-age.net\/0_downloads\/archive\/_SA\/02_NewsPaper_Essay_Sassen.pdf","article_publishing_date":"December 2008","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"2","name":"Saskia","created":"2011-08-24 17:21:14","modified":"2014-05-02 16:17:31","slug":"sassen-saskia","family_name":"Sassen","title":"","email_address":"","photo_legacy":"\/0_images\/02-SSassen.jpg","profile_text":"Saskia Sassen is the Robert S.

Historically, particularly during the period of British colonisation, the distinct worlds active within these cities \u2013 which could be economic, social or cultural \u2013 occupied different spaces and operated under different rules. The aim of their separation was to maximise control and minimise conflict between these, often opposing, worlds.<sup>1<\/sup><\/p>\n<p>However, today these worlds share the same space, but they understand and use it differently.<sup>2<\/sup> Massive waves of distressed rural migration during the latter half of the 1900s triggered their convergence into a singular, but multifaceted entity. Combined with the inadequate supply of urban land and the lack of the creation of new urban centres, this resulted in extremely high densities in existing cities. With the emergence of a post-industrial, service-based economy, the intertwining of these worlds within the same space is now even greater.<sup>3<\/sup><\/p>\n<p>In this post-industrial scenario, cities in India have become critical sites for negotiations between elite and subaltern cultures. The new relationships between social classes in a post-industrial economy are quite different from those that existed in state-controlled economies.<sup>4<\/sup> The fragmentation of the economy in service and production sectors has spatially resulted in a new, bazaar-like urbanism, which has woven its presence throughout the entire urban landscape.<sup>5<\/sup> This is an urbanism created by those outside the elite domains of the formal modernity of the state. It is a \u2018pirate\u2019 modernity that has to slip under the laws of the city simply in order to survive, without any conscious attempt at constructing a counterculture.<sup>6<\/sup> With the retreat of the state in the course of the 1980s and 1990s (in different measures across South Asia), the space of the \u2018everyday\u2019 is where economic and cultural struggles are articulated. These common spaces have been largely excluded from the cultural discourses on globalisation, which focus on elite domains of production in the city.<sup>7<\/sup><\/p>\n<p>Today, Indian cities are comprised of two components occupying the same physical space. The first is the Static City. Built of more permanent material such as concrete, steel and brick, it forms a two-dimensional entity on conventional city maps and is monumental in its presence. The second is the Kinetic City. Incomprehensible as a two-dimensional entity, this is a city in motion \u2013 a three-dimensional construct of incremental development. The Kinetic City is temporary in nature and often built with recycled material: plastic sheets, scrap metal, canvas and waste wood. It constantly modifies and reinvents itself. The Kinetic City\u2019s building blocks are not pieces of architecture, but spaces that hold associative values and that support their residents\u2019 lives and livelihoods. Patterns of occupation determine its form and perception. It is an indigenous urbanism that has its particular \u2018local\u2019 logic. It is not necessarily the city of the poor, as most images might suggest; rather it is a temporal articulation and occupation of space, which not only creates a richer sensibility of spatial occupation, but also suggests how spatial limits are expanded to include formally unimagined uses in dense urban conditions.<sup>8<\/sup><\/p>\n<p>The Kinetic City presents a compelling vision that potentially allows us to better understand the blurred lines of contemporary urbanism and the changing roles of people and spaces in urban society. The increasing concentrations of global flows \u2013 of money and goods \u2013 have exacerbated the inequalities and spatial divisions of social classes. In this context, an architecture or urbanism of equality in an increasingly unequal economic world requires looking deeper to find a wide range of places to mark and commemorate the cultures of those excluded from the spaces of wealth and economic boom. These don\u2019t necessarily lie in the formal production of architecture, but often challenge it. Here the idea of a city is an elastic urban condition, not a grand vision, but a \u2018grand adjustment\u2019.<\/p>\n<p>The Kinetic City can be seen as the symbolic image of the emerging urban South Asian condition. The processions, weddings, festivals, hawkers, street vendors and slum dwellers or <em>Katchi Abadis<\/em>, all create an ever-transforming streetscape \u2013 a city in constant motion where the very physical fabric is characterised by continuous change. The Static City, on the other hand, dependent on architecture for its representation, is no longer the single image by which the city is read. Thus architecture is not the \u2018spectacle\u2019 of the city, nor does it even comprise the single dominant image. In contrast, festivals such as Diwali, Dussera, Navrathri, Muhharam, Durga Puja, Ganesh Chathurthi and many more, have emerged as the spectacles of the Kinetic City. Their presence in the everyday landscape is pervasive and dominates the popular visual culture of Indian cities. Festivals create a forum through which the fantasies of the subalterns are articulated and even organised into political action.<\/p>\n<p>[\u2026]<\/p>\n<p>What then is our cultural reading for the Kinetic City, which now forms a greater part of our urban reality? If the production or preservation of architecture or urban form has to be informed by our reading of cultural significance in this dynamic context, it will necessarily have to include the notion of \u2018constructing significance\u2019 both in the architectural as well as conservation debates.<sup>9<\/sup> In fact, an understanding that \u2018cultural significance\u2019 evolves, will truly clarify the role of the architect as an advocate of change (versus a preservationist who opposes change) \u2013 one who can engage with both the Kinetic and Static City on equal terms. Under such conditions, a draining of the symbolic import of the architectural landscape leads to a deepening of ties between architecture and contemporary realities and experiences. This understanding allows architecture and urban typologies to be transformed through intervention and placed in the service of contemporary life, realities, and emerging aspirations. Here, the Static City embraces the Kinetic City and is informed and remade by its logic.<\/p>\n<p>The phenomenon of bazaars in the Victorian arcades in the old Fort Area, Mumbai\u2019s Historic District, is emblematic of this potential negotiation between the Static and Kinetic City. The original use of the arcades was two-fold. First, they provided spatial mediation between building and street. Second, the arcades were a perfect response to Bombay\u2019s climate. They served as a zone protecting pedestrians from both the harsh sun and lashing rains. Today, with the informal bazaar occupying the arcade, its original intent is challenged. This emergent relationship of the arcade and bazaar not only forces a confrontation of uses and interest groups, but also demands new preservation approaches. For the average Mumbai resident, the hawker provides a wide range of goods at prices considerably lower than those found in local shops. Thus, the bazaars in the arcades characterise the Fort Area area\u2019s thriving businesses. For the elite and for conservationists, the Victorian core represents the old city centre, complete with monumental icons. In fact, as the city sprawls, dissipating the clarity of its form, these images, places, and icons acquire even greater meaning for preservationists as critical symbols of the city\u2019s historic image. Consequently, hawking is deemed illegal by city authorities that are constantly attempting to relocate the bazaars.<\/p>\n<p>The challenge in Mumbai is to cope with the city\u2019s transformation, not by inducing or polarising its dualism, but by attempting to reconcile these opposite conditions as being simultaneously valid. The existence of two worlds in the same space implies that we must accommodate and overlap varying uses, perceptions, and physical forms. The arcades in the Fort Area possess a rare capacity for reinterpretation. As an architectural solution, they display an incredible resilience; they can accommodate new uses while keeping the illusion of their architecture intact.<\/p>\n<p>One design solution might be to re-adapt the functioning of the arcades. They could be restructured to allow for easy pedestrian movement and accommodate hawkers at the same time. They could contain the amorphous bazaar encased in the illusion of the disciplined Victorian arcade. With this sort of approach, the key components of the city would have a greater ability to survive, because they could be more adaptable to changing economic and social conditions. There are no total solutions in an urban landscape characterised by both permanence and rapid transformation. At best, the city could constantly evolve and invent solutions for the present through safeguarding the crucial components of our historically important \u2018urban hardware\u2019. Could \u2018Bazaars in Victorian Arcades\u2019 become an authentic symbol of an emergent reality of temporary adjustment? Clearly the Static and Kinetic Cities go beyond their obvious differences to establish a much richer relationship, both spatially and metaphorically, than their physical manifestations would suggest. Here affinity and rejection are simultaneously played out \u2013 in a state of equilibrium maintained by a seemingly irresolvable tension.<\/p>\n<p>The informal economy of the city vividly illustrates the collapsed and intertwined existence of the Static and Kinetic Cities. The <em>dabbawalas<\/em> (literally translated as \u2018tiffin men\u2019) are an example of this relationship between the formal and informal, the static and kinetic. The tiffin delivery service, which relies on the train system for transportation, costs approx Rs.200 (US$4) per month. A <em>dabbawala<\/em> picks up a lunch tiffin from a house anywhere in the city. Then he delivers the tiffin to one\u2019s place of work by lunchtime and returns it to the house later in the day. The <em>dabbawalas<\/em> deliver hundreds of thousands of lunch boxes every day. The efficiency of Mumbai\u2019s train system, the spine of the linear city, enables this complex informal system to work. The <em>dabbawalas<\/em> have innovatively set up a network that facilitates an informal system to take advantage of a formal infrastructure. The network involves the <em>dabba<\/em>, or tiffin, being exchanged up to four or five times between its pickup and return to the house in the evening. The average box travels about 30 km (18 miles) each way. It is estimated that around 200,000 boxes are delivered around the city per day, involving approximately 4,500 <em>dabbawalas<\/em>. In economic terms, the annual turnover amounts to roughly 50 million Rupees or about a US$1 million.<sup>10<\/sup><\/p>\n<p>Entrepreneurship in the Kinetic City is an autonomous and oral process that demonstrates the ability to fold the formal and informal into a symbiotic relationship. The dabbawalas, like several other informal services that range from banking, money transfer, courier, and electronic goods bazaars, leverage community relationships and networks and deftly use the Static City and its infrastructure beyond its intended margins. These networks create a synergy that depends on mutual integration without the obsession of formalised structures. The Kinetic City is where the intersection of need (often reduced to survival) and unexploited potentials of existing infrastructure give rise to new innovative services. The trains in Mumbai are emblematic of a kinetic space, supporting and blurring the formal and the informal, slicing through these worlds while momentarily collapsing them into a singular entity. Here the self-consciousness about modernity and the regulations imposed by the Static City are suspended and redundant. The Kinetic City carries local wisdom into the contemporary world without fear of the modern, while the Static City aspires to erase the local and re-codify it in a written \u2018macro-moral\u2019 order.<sup>11<\/sup><\/p>\n<p>The urbanism of Mumbai represents a fascinating intersection where the Kinetic City \u2013 a landscape of dystopia, and yet a symbol of optimism \u2013 challenges the Static City \u2013 encoded in architecture \u2013 to reposition and remake the city as a whole.<sup>12<\/sup> The Kinetic City forces the Static City to re-engage itself in present conditions by dissolving its utopian project to fabricate multiple dialogues with its context. Could this become the basis for a rational discussion about coexistence? Or is Mumbai\u2019s emergent urbanism inherently paradoxical, and are the coexistence of the Static and Kinetic Cities and their particular states of utopia and dystopia inevitable? Can the spatial configuration for how this simultaneity occurs actually be formally imagined? The Kinetic City obviously cannot be seen as a design tool, but rather as a demand that conceptions of urbanism create and facilitate environments that are versatile and flexible, robust and ambiguous enough to allow this kinetic quality of the city to flourish. Perhaps the Kinetic City might be the tactical approach to take when dealing with the urbanism of the temporary, of high densities and intensities? In spite of these many potential disjunctures, what this reading of the city does celebrate is the dynamic and pluralist processes that make the urban Indian landscape. Within this urbanism, the Static and Kinetic cities necessarily coexist and blur into an integral entity, even if momentarily, to create the margins for adjustment that their simultaneous existences demand.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"<p>This article is based on an essay entitled \u2019Negotiating the Static and Kinetic Cities\u2019 published in A.

This is the problem we face with today&#8217;s new \u2018smart city\u2019 tools \u2013 the CCTV cameras, motion sensors, and computers capable of processing immense amounts of data. The problem is in a way understandable. It takes a long time and much experiment, entailing failure as well as success, to plumb a tool&#8217;s possibilities. This was the case, for instance, of the hardened-edge scalpel, which appeared in the sixteenth century: surgeons required nearly a century to figure out best practices and innovative operations with a super sharp knife. <\/p>\n<p>But tools for the smart city come with a sting in the tail. Their application can inhibit experiment by ordinary urbanites in their everyday lives. A large city can be thought of as a complex organism whose innards do not work perfectly in sync, whose parts do not add up to a unified whole. Yet there is something valuable just about these dissonances. They can create opportunities economically, when someone seizes on a market irregularity, while lack of coherent control enables personal liberty, and disorder might make subjective experience rich and multi-layered \u2013 at least novelists from Defoe to Proust hoped so. To take advantage of these possibilities, the big city needs to be <em>learnt<\/em>. The risk is that new technologies might repress the inductive and deductive processes people use to make sense, for themselves, of the complex conditions in which they live. The smart city would then become a stupefying smart city.<\/p>\n<p>When a new tool proves deadening rather than liberating in use, our first instinct may be to blame the machine itself. That is what Lyon\u2019s silk weavers in the eighteenth century did; they attacked mechanised looms as \u2018perfidious works of the devil\u2019. Instead of blaming the machine, we want to ask how the new urban technologies can be used more intelligently \u2013 which is more a question about urban planning and vision than about machinery. What kinds of urban design empower people in the street to experiment with their behaviour, and to draw their own conclusions from those experiments?<\/p>\n<p>In the 1930s, urbanists like the American Lewis Mumford and architects like the Swiss Sigfried Giedion worried about machines and materials in relation to urban design. Mumford challenged the urban planners\u2019 uncritical embrace of the automobile; Giedion attacked the architects\u2019 conservative use of new building materials. Digital technology has shifted the technological focus to information processing. This can occur in handhelds linked to \u2018clouds\u2019 or in command and control centres. The issue is: who controls such information and how is this information organised? Which in turn raises new issues of urban design. The questions the technology poses are much more profound than which software to buy.<\/p>\n<p>In this light, I want to make first a comparison between designs that create a stupefying smart city and designs that envision a stimulating smart city. By drawing this contrast, a formal issue then appears: that of the difference between a closed and an open system.  And a social possibility emerges as well: the use of stimulating, open system technology to render the city more informal. My own comments here draw on a decade of research done by Urban Age on the visual and social conditions that can enable urbanites to take ownership over their lives.<\/p>\n<h1>Two Stupefying Smart Cities<\/h1>\n<p>Imagine that you are a masterplanner facing a blank computer screen and that you can design a city from scratch, free to incorporate every bit of high tech into your design. You might come up with Masdar, in the United Arab Emirates, or Songdo, in South Korea.  These are two versions of the stupefying smart city, Masdar the more famous, or infamous, Songdo the more fascinating in a perverse way.<\/p>\n<p>Masdar is a half-built city rising out of the desert, planning of which has been overseen by the master architect Norman Foster. The plan comprehensively lays out the activities of the city, in which technology monitors and regulates the function from a central command centre. This is to conceive of the city in &#8216;Fordist&#8217; terms \u2013 that is, each activity has an appropriate place and time. Urbanites become consumers of choices laid out for them by prior calculations of where to shop or to get a doctor the most efficiently.<\/p>\n<p>Such practical knowledge is always necessary; the question is how urbanites get it. Foster&#8217;s idea is that there is a one-way flow from the central command centre (CCC) to the handheld. The handheld (that is, the urbanite) can report information, but the CCC makes the interpretation of what it means and how the handheld should act upon it. Masdar is an extreme in this, and also in conceiving that no knowledge of the city has to be fought for. So there&#8217;s no cognitive stimulation through trial and error, no personal encounter with resistance. User-friendly in Foster&#8217;s plan \u2013 expensive fantasy that it is \u2013 means choosing menu options rather than creating the menu.<\/p>\n<p>There is a further issue here: creating a new menu entails, as it were, being in the wrong place at the wrong time. In nineteenth-century European cities, for instance, new markets for semi-legal goods developed at the supposedly dead zones near the city&#8217;s walls; so in twentieth-century American cities like Boston, new \u2018brain industries\u2019 developed at the edges, in places whose zoning never imagined their growth. Foster&#8217;s idea of the city on the contrary assumes a clairvoyant sense of what should grow where. Put crudely, Foster&#8217;s city is over-zoned: the algorithms of the CPU do not envision their own violation.<\/p>\n<p>Songdo represents the stupefying smart city in its architectural aspect. It is no accident that Songdo is so badly designed. The massive units of housing are not conceived as structures with any individuality in themselves, nor are the ensemble of these faceless buildings meant to create a sense of place. The structures are programmed simply as functions. Uniform architecture need not inevitably produce a dead environment, if there is some flexibility at the ground plane. In New York, for instance, the ground plane of essentially monotonous residential towers is subdivided into small irregular units, which yield, along the Third Avenue in the 1920s or again the 1960s to the 1990s, a sense of neighbourhood. But in Songdo, lacking that elemental principle of diversity within the block, there is nothing to be learnt from walking the streets. And user intelligence of urban space arises basically from ground-plane experience.<\/p>\n<p>When working in Mumbai, Urban Age research found Songdo-like efforts at urban design to be counterproductive. In Mumbai&#8217;s Dharavi slum, a city in itself of nearly a million people, many efforts have been made to erase the anarchy that seems to reign on the streets, to push the built environment upward, off the street, in order to make it more orderly. These efforts have largely failed, rejected by people who instead use their own street smarts for survival. <\/p>\n<h1>A Smart Smart City<\/h1>\n<p>A more intelligent attempt to create a smart city comes from work currently under way in Rio de Janeiro. Rio existed long before the computer, and its history includes the appearance of massive poverty and of violent crime, but equally of complex and living tissues of local life. Its collective physiology is not that of a well-balanced organism, made worse by its topography, a city subject to devastating flash floods. Yet its inhabitants, struggling against the odds, have made a life for themselves which most of them prize.<\/p>\n<p>The role of new information technologies in such a city could not be more different than that in cities designed from scratch like Masdar and Songdo. Led by IBM, with assistance from Cisco and other subcontractors, the technologies have been applied to forecasting physical disasters, to coordinating responses to traffic crises, and to organising police work on crime. The new command centre for these activities, IBM&#8217;s local director tells us, looks forward to getting the city in reasonable condition to host the next Olympic Games. To make this centre work has required more political effort than sheer technological innovation, since Rio&#8217;s government bureaucracy has been a landscape of isolated silos; the implementation of new technology has required an engaged mayor.<\/p>\n<p>The advent of computerised information sharing has not been entirely benign, in the eyes of some citizens, since the police can now be more coercive more effectively \u2013 and technological modernisation, like other forms of modernisation, can be used as a cover for disempowering or physically dispossessing the poor. Still, the principle of machine use here is coordination rather than prescription, as were the cases in Masdar and Songdo. The technology is meant to be responsive to conditions not of its own making. <\/p>\n<p>It could be objected that this comparison is unfair. Would not people in the favelas prefer, if they had a choice, a pre-organised, already-planned place in which to live? The research Urban Age has carried out over the last years suggests that once urbanites rise above the poverty level, they in fact don&#8217;t. The prospect of the orderly city has not be a lure for voluntary migration, neither in the past to European cities, nor today to the sprawling cities of South America and Asia. If they have a choice, people want a more open, indeterminate city in which to make their way: that is how they can come to take ownership over their own lives. <\/p>\n<h1>Open and Closed Systems<\/h1>\n<p>There is a formal issue involved here: the contrast between the determinative and the coordinative use of technology shows at a deeper level the difference between a closed and an open system. Put simply, a car engine is a closed system while a discussion is, or should be, an open system. More detailed, in a closed system unforeseen activity is either integrated into the existing rules \u2013 the algorithms \u2013 of the system, or expelled as irrelevant \u2018noise\u2019. Both feedback loops and exclusion help the closed system maintain its equilibrium. Whereas in an open system, balance is not so much the aim: the system is programmed to evolve, being open to the unforeseen, changing its very structure as it absorbs new data. \u2018Noise\u2019 is valued. Yet another way to think about the difference is that open and closed equate linear and non-linear. In a closed system, when change occurs it is meant to happen in a one-after-another problem-solving fashion, whereas the process of change in an open system does not try to resolve all conflicts; its greater emphasis on chance means that the system inhabits non-linear time.<\/p>\n<p>Cities are open, non-linear systems. They grow in unpredictable ways, which would be missed by closed-system thinking. For instance, increasing population density in cities follows an erratic, non-linear path \u2013 even more so in today&#8217;s Asian and Latin American megacities than in the European cities of the nineteenth century. It would be bad science if we tried to model this growth using closed-system concepts of equilibrium and integration. Again, at a certain point large size and high density make for new urban forms; Rio is something more of a public realm than the addition of all its individual streets. The danger of much closed-system urbanism is to treat the city instead as nodes and locales that can be added up, a linear progression up from the small to the large or down from the large to the small. Exactly this kind of urbanism appears in the planning of Masdar and Songdo.<\/p>\n<h1>Informality<\/h1>\n<p>In sum, a better use of new technologies would focus more on coordination than on command, and it would suppose an evolutionary, open system rather than a steady-state, closed system. Further, smart-smart urbanism should follow specific planning principles, privileging the complexity of ground-plane design, recognising the cognitive value of pedestrian experience. The result would be that technology might aid informal social relations rather than repress informality in the name of coherent control. The use of Facebook in the Arab Spring of 2011 is an obvious and extreme example of doing so, but in more peaceful urban conditions why should we want to marry the technological and the informal?<\/p>\n<p>Informal social processes are the genius of the city \u2013 the source of innovation economically and the foundation of an arousing social life. Technology must be part of the process of giving the city that informal energy \u2013 and can do so, if we think of our new technological tools as enabling the open systems of the city.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":"","article_publishing_date":"December 2012","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"23","name":"Richard","created":"2011-10-04 13:06:04","modified":"2014-04-08 17:47:21","slug":"sennett-richard","family_name":"Sennett","title":"","email_address":"","photo_legacy":"","profile_text":"Richard Sennett is Professor of Sociology, LSE and University Professor of the Humanities, New York University.","organization":"LSE Cities, London School of Economics and Political Science","role":"Chair of the Advisory Board","additional_affiliations":"Professor of Sociology, London School of Economics and Political Sciences\nUniversity Professor of the Humanities, New York University","qualifications":"","staff_pages_blurb":"Richard Sennett is a sociologist and Professor of Sociology at the London School of Economics and Political Sciences, and University Professor of the Humanities at New York University.

The most widely held popular perception about Mumbai is that of a city of opportunity for people from across South Asia, and now even beyond. These opportunities have of course been distributed unevenly, with Mumbai\u2019s rich and poor co-existing, and not always peacefully, with fundamentally differing entitlements to basic services \u2013 water and sanitation, health care and nutrition. In some of its large slums \u2013 the suppliers of cheap labour \u2013 children from poorer homes die because these slums exhibit malnutrition, morbidity and mortality levels closer to those current in the states of Bihar or Orissa. About 60 per cent of Mumbai\u2019s population lives in such slum areas, occupying a mere 8 per cent of land, and their lives are characterised by degraded housing, poor hygiene, congestion, inadequate civic services and yet expanding peripheries of its slumming suburbs \u2013 with Dharavi as its epicentre.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-154\" title=\"07_ref_Uncovering%20the%20Myth1\" src=\"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/10\/07_ref_Uncovering%20the%20Myth12.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"396\" height=\"392\" \/><\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Population change in a megapolis like Mumbai occurs both due to natural increase and migration. While migration has in the past played a significant role in changing the demographic profile of Mumbai, the contribution of migration to population growth has declined consistently. This decline has happened in tandem with an unprecedented natural increase in the population.<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Migration from northern Indian states increased substantially between 1961 and 2001 and is higher than migration to the city from within the state, and continues to remain male dominated. Much of this migrant population is being absorbed by Mumbai\u2019s peripheral urban agglomerations like Navi Mumbai, Thane, Kalyan and Mira-Bhayander, thus, contrary to what is generally perceived, not congesting the main city districts. There is a significant dispersal of population from Greater Mumbai to these nearby cities. This is also evident from the population growth differential between Greater Mumbai and other units of the Greater Mumbai Urban Agglomeration \u2013 showing that the rate of migration is much faster in these Urban Agglomerations than in Greater Mumbai itself. Secondly, it is the migrants from within the state settling down, coupled with the birth rate within the city that contributes to its population growth.<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Migration from the southern states of India has declined between 1961 and 2001. This change took place over a period of time and was fuelled by a number of natural evolutionary factors, such as changing employment patterns from manufacturing to commercial and service sectors, especially IT, banking, media and communications. People from the south also found other destinations such as Bangalore and Hyderabad. This trend gives important clues on how policy interventions can be induced to decelerate migration into already unwieldy cities like Mumbai.<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">It is worthwhile to understand the initial development of suburban areas of Mumbai from a historical perspective. Upon the circular issued to the Bombay Chamber of Commerce and the Municipal Corporation in 1908, inviting suggestions for addressing the problem of acute shortage of housing for the poor, Arthur Crawford, the then Municipal Commissioner, emphasised the importance of comprehensive urban planning in his \u2018The Development of New Bombay: A pamphlet\u2019. This was the beginning of the city\u2019s urban sprawl. In the 1960s the distribution of the population presented an interesting scenario with the island and suburbs having a more or less equal share. The suburbs have grown at a much faster rate over the past three decades contributing to increased density. Effective planned development of suburbs has not taken off as envisaged due to the lack of supporting infrastructure and a sound policy environment for development of residential and commercial nodes.<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The availability of physical space for people living in the city can be understood as a key factor in the quality of life of the city\u2019s residents. The population density defined as number of persons living within an area of 1 km2 presents the most striking feature about Mumbai. In 2001, the average population density for Mumbai city was 27,000 people per km2. Ward C is one of the most densely populated areas with a density of 114,001 people per km2.<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Mumbai\u2019s economy has witnessed a significant transition in the pattern of employment during the last four decades. Today a majority of the employment is in the tertiary sector, which accounts for almost 81 per cent of the total employment. The growth of the financial sector fostered the growth of other sectors such as telecommunications, construction and real estate. Employment in the informal sector (wage labourers, hawkers) has grown at a faster rate than that in the formal sector, resulting in its share of total employment increasing over time. The growth of formal-sector employment in the services sector has not been adequate to fill the gap and thus former mill and other manufacturing workers were absorbed by the informal sector.<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">A large majority of the male migrants (49.1 per cent) coming to Mumbai are employed in \u2018production related\u2019 jobs. In terms of inter-industry distribution, a majority of them work in industries requiring semi-skilled and unskilled workers with minimal educational qualifications. In contrast, the non-migrants have dominated white-collared professional, technical, executive and managerial jobs, including clerical and sales jobs in various service-based industries that outnumber jobs taken by migrants. The current rapid growth of the Indian economy is fuelled by these various movements of labour. But, the current forms of migration are not only a sign of dynamism \u2013 they also reflect and come with increasing inequalities, agrarian crises and inadequate employment generation in many parts of rural and urban India.<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Large construction activities and other major public works in Greater Mumbai depend upon labour drawn from villages within and outside Maharashtra. While the migrants are indispensable to the city\u2019s economy as they fulfil the demand for low-paid and unskilled jobs, their residential patterns are being altered fundamentally. In the recent past the residential pattern of Mumbai showed slums co-existing with better-off residential complexes locating the poor close to their workspaces. The accelerated slum clearance programme may be creating opportunity for the poor to \u2018own\u2019 their houses, but a side effect is that it severely compromises their ability to access viable livelihoods as they are forced to relocate to the far peripheral areas of the suburbs.<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The notion of lack of space within the city is a contested one when as areas of prime land are locked up in dead mills in the heart of the city. In addition, there are huge stretches of dock land on the eastern waterfront that are lying redundant. Finally there are the salt pan lands that cannot be used because of obsolete land ceiling legislations applicable in the city. Migration and the resulting slums are inevitable as the cities will always be magnets attracting people for better economic opportunities. What is important is a multi-pronged approach to slow down migration and to also manage and troubleshoot it properly through strategies such as alternate urban centres, the creation of sustainable rural business hubs and the provision of affordable housing within the city.<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Given the ever-expanding volume of traffic between the city and suburbs it is important to develop efficient and sustainable transport networks that facilitate faster movements at lower social, environmental and economic costs. The option of the metrorail coupled with monorail and underground parking lots is seen as the best option. It is however of great significance that out of 135 metro corporations in the world, only 4 are making operational profits. These include the metrorail transports in Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Delhi. The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC), is said to also be falling into the trap of loss-making corporations, with losses amounting to 76.33 crore (US$19.3 million) annually, as reported by a leading daily newspaper. Some transport experts are suggesting that the total project costs of the metro, presently estimated at 19,525 crore (US$4.9 billion), may have been gravely under-projected and will in actuality be three times higher. Considering Mumbai\u2019s topography, land constraints and the massive disruption and displacement and relocation of people and other infrastructure involved, the costs in Mumbai are likely to be astronomical. However decision makers seem unimpressed by the availability of safe, indigenous and relatively low cost, high load bearing, sustainable, and scalable commercially ready technologies like Skybus or Rapid Bus Transit Systems.<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">____________________________________________<\/p>\n<p>[1] K.

And a lot of the planning professionals agreed. It is not hard to see why. The utopias of post-World War II planning had conspicuously failed to live up to the promises made for them. Dynamiting the Pruitt-Igoe housing estate in St. Louis was a huge and visible signal of all that could go wrong. But perhaps of greater significance to the low regard in which planning was held was Sir Peter Hall\u2019s book <em>Great Planning Disasters<\/em>, published in 1981. Hall, one of the most influential urbanists of the second half of the twentieth century, took a scalpel to five fiascos, all of them intended to have been exercises in transformative planning. He looked at the absurdly expensive and inconclusive story of London\u2019s strategy for a third airport, a story that more than 40 years later is still no nearer resolution. He was no more sympathetic to the Bay Area Rapid Transit system, which San Francisco did build, at least in part, and to the Opera House in Sydney.<br \/>\nOpinion on the effectiveness of at least one of these projects has changed in the interim, but the book summed up a view of the dangers implicit in adopting big ideas about planning. They are expensive, they take too long, and often they don\u2019t work.<\/p>\n<p>If even some professionals saw things this way, it was no wonder that in the wider world of activists, intellectuals and politicians, as well as the everyday victims of slum clearances, and motorway construction, there was revulsion against any further evisceration of Europe\u2019s and North America\u2019s great cities, from London to Brussels, and Paris to Manhattan. Even in Japan, a country that has shown no reluctance to embrace break-neck modernisation, a generation of radical students spent a decade fighting riot police to stop the building of Narita Airport. The claims of rice farmers working on ancestral land were far more important for them than giving Japan a modern gateway to the world.<\/p>\n<p>From her vantage point in Greenwich Village, Jane Jacobs stopped Robert Moses\u2019s road building plans, and published her devastating attack on those who attempted drastic surgery on the fabric of the city. Small, she believed, was the future. Cities should be nurtured, not transformed. Not everyone believed her. Lewis Mumford reviewed <em>The Life and Death of Great American Cities<\/em> for <em>the New Yorker<\/em>, under the headline: \u2018Home Remedies for Urban Cancer\u2019.<\/p>\n<p>But when Robert Caro wrote his onslaught on Robert Moses, <em>The Powerbroker<\/em>, he made the very idea of urban transformation suspect. Robert Lee, Mayor of New Haven in the 1960s, a Robert Moses for the Kennedy era, appeared on the front pages to boast that he had rid his city of what he called the shame of the 10,000 rats evicted from just one run-down block in his campaign of scorched-earth planning. But after New Haven burnt in race riots, Lee\u2019s approach looked a lot less plausible and planning took a much lower profile. It merely became a statistical analysis, or, at least, it was now shaped by many small steps, rather than in a single <em>coup de th\u00e9\u00e2tre<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>Barcelona changed all that. This was a city in which architects, planners and politicians had suffered in the same prison cells during the Franco years, and were close enough to each other to be able to embark on the renewal of their city once the dictator had gone. It is true that there were protests about the gentrification of the red light district, and the destruction of the El Poblenou community on the waterfront. But the massive investment in infrastructure after the punishment of the city in the Franco years really did transform Barcelona in a universally popular way. Barcelona went from darkened, crumbling neglect to an architectural showcase that brought jobs, tourists and creative energy. It became a world city. And as a result it became a model for other attempts to transform cities around the world. From John Prescott, Tony Blair\u2019s hapless planning minister, to the Mayor of Shanghai, everybody came to learn the lessons of Barcelona.<\/p>\n<p>It was at least a more worthwhile lesson than the idea that a single building, in the Bilbao style, can transform a city. But a Spain in the grip of economic trauma no longer looks such a promising model for the world to learn from. Valencia in particular is a city that wasted a fortune on the vain glory of Santiago Calatrava. Barcelona did a lot of very sensible things to transform itself. But from the shuttered and empty Forum designed by Herzog &amp; de Meuron, and built in a bout of hubris, to the Design Hub, designed by Martorell, Bohigas, and Mackay, and built under the shadow of Jean Nouvel\u2019s Torre Agbar, without a real brief, it has shown itself better at starting things than it is at sustaining them.<\/p>\n<p>Nowhere has this pessimism about the transformative potential of planning become clearer than in the idea of big event planning encapsulated by the idea of staging an Olympic games in the name of urbanism. For Barcelona it worked. For London it probably will too. The eastern fringes of the UK\u2019s capital city had been the subject of long-term plans for decades. The Olympics finally put the infrastructure in place, and Stratford really has had the kick-start it needed to reverse London\u2019s endless prejudice for looking West rather than East. But for Montreal, the Olympics, and the Expo that preceded them, were almost as much of a financial catastrophe as they were for Athens. It is curious how in all the forensic analysis of the Greek economic meltdown associated with its membership of the Eurozone, little attention is paid to its borrowing spree to finance the Games and build all those pointless landmarks, now empty, in accounting for how things went so wrong. All these disasters make it easy to flinch away from any attempt to address the large and real problems that cities face, and to believe that they can be dealt with in small, comfortable, almost invisible steps.<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes it seems as if all the complex arguments about how we should understand the future of cities might boil down to the resolution of just two questions that represent polar opposites. Are we best served by high- or by low-density models of urbanism? Is the market a better guide for shaping development than the State? They are models that keep appearing and reappearing around the world.<\/p>\n<p>But perhaps, there is another, even more fundamental, question to face up to. What can we really do in order to address what might be described as the urban bigger picture, in order to transform it to achieve positive effects? Are urban transformations actually possible? Or should we avoid the fall-out from taking risks, and confine ourselves instead to small, incremental steps, and attempt to deal with one pothole, and one traffic jam at a time? If for nothing else, because we want to avoid the law of unexpected consequences? Critics of big-picture planning characterise it as being concerned more with the image of development, than with its substance. It is presented as the product of egotistical politicians and their officials, sometimes incompetent, or corrupt, and always tending towards hubris. And instead they argue for a bottom-up approach.<\/p>\n<p>Putting the argument that image building has always been a vitally important contributory factor in creating successful cities to one side, the greatest example suggesting that big-picture planning could work used to be the Paris of Haussmann and Napoleon III. For those who understand city planning on such a scale as primarily political in its motivations, it is true that the glory of the city of light did not keep Napoleon in power, or dissuade Prussia from invading France during the year of the Paris Commune. So on these terms it might be said to be a failure. But Paris is still a model for those who see the city as a work of art; a city that is capable of being completed, and as a result ready to accept a steady state. This is not an entirely positive model. The Paris that is defined by the limits of the P\u00e9riph\u00e9rique is incapable of the kind of change that brought the city into being in the first place. Paris, if present trends continue, is fated to become a large-scale version of Venice, while the banlieues would be happy if they were able to turn into Mestre. Paris\u2019s success was also the source of its failure. The Grand Projets of President Mitterrand in the 1980s could only change the architectural language, not the basic structure of the French capital.<\/p>\n<p>Haussmann did not just build boulevards, and visually highly regimented streets. He installed the sewers that allowed Paris to escape from the medieval scourge of cholera. The dispossessed of Paris had to pay a price. For those who are looking to find a negative impact from the transformation of Morro da Provid\u00eancia in Rio into the Porto Maravilha, the city\u2019s promised glittering new waterfront, or the pacification of the Complexo do Alem\u00e3o, or, for that matter, the rebuilding of the centre of Mumbai and of Shanghai, Haussmann\u2019s Paris provided a clue about what was to come. Paris was a century and a half ahead of Rio, Shanghai and Mumbai in seeing the eviction of existing communities from the homes they had occupied for a generation or two, to barrack life on the outer edges of the city, while wealthy speculators have profited from their forced departure. The same pattern was repeated in each city.<\/p>\n<p>It is an example that for 20 years provided an extraordinarily seductive model for cities looking to use big events as catalysts for large-scale urban transformation. Barcelona\u2019s recent history in the past 25 years has a lot to do with the continuing willingness of cities to bid for the chance to pour billions of dollars, pounds, roubles or reais into bouts of stadium building and mass transit construction. And it is behind the fetish that the Olympic commission has made of the concept of legacy since the Beijing games, or earlier. Legacy and sustainability are an inevitable part of the rhetoric of the modern games now. Even Athens was able to persuade itself for a moment that it was bankrupting Greece for the sake of the Games in order to secure its future. The danger is that in regarding the big picture with suspicion, we end up with the worst of all worlds when we cannot avoid the challenge.<\/p>\n<p>Rio is far from alone in facing the difficult questions about big-picture planning. The history of social housing in Britain, where in some areas there have been three cycles of demolition and rebuilding to different models in a single lifetime, would suggest the difficulty of expecting a big-idea approach to cities to work. Whatever we do, no matter how much we invest, gains are only temporary; one generation\u2019s modernist utopia inexorably seems to turn into the slums of the next. The argument in London, about how to deal with Heathrow airport that is choking with passengers to the point that it is undermining the economic future of London, and so of Britain as a whole, reflects the reluctance, both of governments and the political class, to face up to large questions. But it is worth pointing out that Heathrow, Europe\u2019s busiest airport, was not the product of a grand plan, but a series of accidents, and unintended consequences. London\u2019s first international airport in the 1920s and 1930s was in Croydon, far to the South of the city. Heathrow was an accident. Its first runway was built at the end of World War II as a jumping-off point for British bombers to attack Germany. In the postwar period, it became a civilian airport by default, with a tent for a departure hall. And it has gone on growing ever since.<\/p>\n<p>Britain is divided between those who see Isambard Kingdom Brunel \u2013 the great nineteenth-century engineer \u2013 as a hero, and those who regard him as a heroic failure. Of course, Brunel\u2019s idea of a broad-gauge railway was technically superior to the standard gauge that almost the whole world adopted. If all the existing railways had been torn up and relayed to Brunel\u2019s broad gauge, it would have produced a better railway. But it was already too late: the world was full of expensive locomotives that could only run on the existing tracks. There was no point in wasting time on what might be better. Broad gauge was better than standard, but it was not the best possible railway. A more effective engineer would have focused on making the best of the possible.<\/p>\n<p>The fundamental questions for any city in search of a transformative future are; does it have the ability to articulate a vision shared by its citizens, and does it have the ability to make the vision possible? Rio saw the consequences of big-picture planning half a century ago, when Brazil\u2019s president Juscelino Kubitchek decided to follow the promises of the country\u2019s constitution, and move the national capital to the entirely new city of Bras\u00edlia. The problem for those who question how appropriate big-picture planning can be is that the issues facing cities have only grown larger and more complex. No matter how much we might wish to address them differently, big problems require a response on an appropriate scale.<\/p>\n<p>Ignoring the issues of mobility, of poverty, of security and development, can only make matters more difficult. Leaving those who can afford the cost to create private enclaves with their own police, energy, and services, is clearly an approach that only creates more problems in the future. There are big things happening to the world cities, whether we want them to, or not. Years ago, I compared urbanism to meteorology. If you look carefully enough, you can tell when it is going to rain, but you can\u2019t make it rain. Technologically, that is probably no longer true. Beijing certainly did its best to modify the weather during the Olympics.<\/p>\n<p>But if weather is no longer an appropriate analogy for understanding cities, then perhaps it is also important to understand that art is neither. When Jane Jacobs wrote <em>The Life and Death of Great American Cities<\/em> (1961), she also suggested that a city cannot be a work of art. But that does not mean we should abandon the idea of facing up to the large and troubling problems that cities must address if they are to flourish. The point is that there is no one single plan. Just as the city is never finished, there is never just one plan either: there is always the need to formulate the next one, and to explore the idea of another transformation.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"<p>Deyan Sudjic is Director of the Design Museum, London and co-editor of <em>Living in the Endless City<\/em>.<\/p>\n","pdf_uri":"","article_publishing_date":"October 2013","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"1","name":"Deyan","created":"2011-08-23 13:50:55","modified":"2013-10-23 12:14:25","slug":"sudjic-deyan","family_name":"Sudjic","title":"","email_address":"","photo_legacy":"\/0_images\/02-DSudjic.jpg","profile_text":"<p>Deyan Sudjic is the Director of the Design Museum in London.

Life expectancies at birth are half those of the healthiest cities and it is still common for one in ten children to die before the age of five. Health outcomes are even worse among the lower-income populations of such cities, with anywhere from 30 to 60 per cent of the populations living in such informal settlements. How does density figure in this?<\/p>\n<p>Dense cities developed because of the advantages high density provided for the growth of industry, trade and services \u2013 what are often called the returns to agglomeration for businesses. These advantages can underpin large and economically successful cities even at the same time as health for much of the population and workforce remains very poor. For instance, Mumbai is a very successful city but it is also one where half the population lives in dense informal settlements that take up a small proportion of the land area and which have very inadequate or no provision for water, sanitation, drainage and health care. The same is true in many other cities in Africa, Asia and Latin America. As Arif Hasan notes in &#8216;Designing Density in Karachi: Alternatives to Apartment Blocks&#8217; (2011), 62 per cent of Karachi\u2019s population live in informal settlements that take up only 8 per cent of the land area. Similarly, in Nairobi, more than half the population lives in informal settlements that take up only a few per cent of the city\u2019s land area.<\/p>\n<p>But high density also brings potential advantages for the public good. Returns to agglomeration apply not only to businesses but also to the health and quality of life of city dwellers. For instance, dense cities and city districts provide agglomeration economies for the provision for piped water, good sanitation, drainage, health care, schools, policing and emergency services \u2013 but city governments need the competence and capacity to act on these, and they often have neither. High density informal settlements usually benefit residents by lowering the time and cost of travel to work and to access services \u2013 including those services that make cities special places to live such as theatre, music, museums, libraries, the visual arts, dance, festivals, the enjoyment of historic buildings and districts, diverse choices for eating and the enjoyment of being in a diverse and vibrant place. Cities have also long been places of social, economic and political innovation that have often driven similar changes at higher levels of government.<\/p>\n<p>The residents of high-density informal settlements in central locations value the easy access that such areas provide to income-earning opportunities. The lower or more unstable a person\u2019s income, the more they value accommodation close to income-earning opportunities. Dharavi in Mumbai is a popular place to live among low-income groups not because of its health advantages but because of the economic advantages which result from the large concentration of income-earning opportunities there. The pavement dwellers in Mumbai live where they live not for the health advantages but for the quick, easy and cheap access to income-earning opportunities. In large cities, most low-income groups do not want to move to the city periphery where land may be cheaper and more space available because it brings such high costs in time and money getting to and from work. Cities that work well have diverse accommodation possibilities for lower-income groups so they have a choice in regard to the trade-offs between good location, space and housing quality.<\/p>\n<p>Dense cities also provide more possibilities of combining a high quality of life with lower greenhouse gas emissions. For instance, energy use per building can be cut far more in terraces and apartments than in free-standing housing. Dense cities make high-quality public transport cheaper and, when well-managed, encourage more walking and cycling. Compact urban development can interweave densely settled sites well-connected by public transport with green spaces for sport and recreation and enable urban dwellers to tap into local ecosystem services. Many of the most desirable and expensive residential districts in European cities are also high-density areas, often with terraces with three to six storeys as, for instance, is the case in Chelsea, London. High-income groups choose to live in such areas because of the high quality of life they provide.<\/p>\n<p>There is not much point in singing the virtues of dense cities if these virtues depend on a competence, capacity and accountability of city and municipal governments that is not there. And what can be done for the hundreds of millions of urban dwellers facing very poor health and living conditions in high-density informal settlements? What to do about the informal settlements that may have first developed on the city periphery but, with the growth of the city, now have central locations that are very valuable and are thus under threat?<\/p>\n<p>There are examples that show how dense informal settlements can be transformed into high-quality healthy living environments without displacing their low-income populations. In Thailand, the national government\u2019s Community Organizations Development Institute (CODI) channels government funds in the form of infrastructure subsidies and housing loans direct to community organisations formed by low-income residents of informal settlements. These community organisations then plan and carry out improvements to their housing or develop new housing, and work with local governments or utility companies to provide or improve infrastructure and services. From 2003 to 2010, CODI\u2019s Baan Mankong (secure housing) programme approved 745 projects, covering a total of 80,201 households. A considerable expansion of the programme is also planned within the next few years. Most of the participating communities had high densities but managed to secure more space per person within each house by expanding up to two to three storey terraces as they rebuilt.<\/p>\n<p>This initiative has particular significance in three aspects: its large scale, its substantial community involvement and the extent to which it seeks to institutionalise community-driven solutions within local governments so that they address needs in all informal settlements in each urban centre. It is also significant in that it draws almost entirely from domestic resources, through a combination of national government, local government and household or community contributions. Support is also provided to networks of community organisations formed by the urban poor, to allow them to work with municipal authorities and other local actors and with national agencies on urban centre-wide upgrading programmes.<\/p>\n<p>It is common for informal settlements to have densities of 300 to 500 people per hectare. By upgrading to two- or three-storey terraced housing, the Baan Mankong communities were able to achieve much-improved housing conditions and public space provision. Similar densities are also evident in some high-quality residential areas in wealthy European cities, typically four- to six-storey terraces.<\/p>\n<p>Informal settlements with much higher densities \u2013 for instance between 1,500 and 3,500 people per hectare \u2013 present more of a challenge. This is the case in some of the informal settlements in Nairobi, in Dharavi in Mumbai and in some residential areas in Karachi. In principle, it is possible to support low-income housing development to achieve high density, applying the lessons of successful urban upgrading, but transferring them to high-density low-rise developments. But it is difficult for residents and their organisations to retain control of upgrading when this involves the construction of multi-storey buildings, as was the case in Sri Lanka, leaving them open to displacement or ill-suited upgrades.<br \/> Arif Hasan and colleagues have shown that it is possible to achieve high densities while meeting the needs and priorities of low- and middle-income residents in Karachi. Rather than constructing multi-storey buildings, small residential plots can be developed incrementally by the residents themselves, as long as the initial construction is sufficiently solid to allow safe expansion. This approach allows the family to retain control of the land and its development. Densities of up to 2,800 people per hectare were possible based on this kind of household-led development.<br \/> However, in very high-density settings, the trade-off between indoor space, space for transport, public and private open spaces such as squares, parks and gardens and space for public amenities is complex.<\/p>\n<p>Bringing trunk infrastructure and a functioning road network into a dense informal settlement usually requires some loss of housing, and therefore the displacement of residents. So too will any expansion of public space and public services, such as schools and health care services.<br \/> One solution to this trade-off in very high-density informal settlements is to acquire land next to the settlement being upgraded so as to allow some reduction in density. Such land is, however, rarely available. To avoid moving (or being moved), residents may choose to sacrifice space within their homes for the economic advantages of the location and to maintain their social networks. Overcrowding is usually more tolerable if there is good provision for piped water, electricity and functioning, safe toilets and waste water disposal in each home.<\/p>\n<p>Initiatives are underway that seek to upgrade informal settlements with very high densities. One such upgrade is ongoing in Pune, India, managed by Mahila Milan, a federation of women\u2019s savings groups formed by those living in informal settlements or on the pavements, the National Slum Dwellers Federation and the Society for the Promotion of Area Resource Centres (SPARC). At the core of the programme is a process that engages each household in developing and agreeing to the best trade-offs for the upgrade. Another example can be found in Dharavi where around 600,000 people live in two square kilometres (1 1\/5 square miles). An alternative plan to its commercial development centres around developing upgrading plans section by section with residents.<\/p>\n<p>The trade-offs between living space and public amenities for any high-density upgrade are complex. These initiatives share a commitment by city governments to work with all the residents and their community organisations to seek the best workable compromise. This is much easier for governments in cases where representative organisations have been formed by those living in informal settlements and want to work with them, as is the case with the national and city federations of slum or shack dwellers that are now active in over 20 nations.<br \/> High density can serve development when it is created by people\u2019s choice, even if this means living in informal settlements. This is especially so when city governments work with those living in informal settlements to take advantage of their agglomeration economies and provide the infrastructure and services that can transform health and quality of life.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/11\/2011_chw_4070_Satterthwaite.pdf","article_publishing_date":"November 2011","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"6","name":"David","created":"2011-08-30 11:09:52","modified":"2012-07-11 16:05:41","slug":"satterthwaite-david","family_name":"Satterthwaite","title":null,"email_address":"","photo_legacy":"","profile_text":"<p>David Satterthwaite is a Senior Fellow at the International Institute for Environment and Development and editor of the international journal, \u2018Environment and Urbanization\u2019.<\/p>","organization":"Human Settlements Group","role":"Fellow","additional_affiliations":"Editor, Environment and Urbanization, International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED)","qualifications":"","staff_pages_blurb":"David Satterthwaite is a Senior Fellow at the International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED) and Editor of the international journal Environment and Urbanization.

Residential density is largely driven by topographical constraints, the location of public transport and other infrastructure, but also by each city\u2019s inherited traditions of urban culture and development. Density differs widely, from the high densities of Hong Kong, Mumbai and central areas of Istanbul and Shanghai to the much lower density pattern of London. Johannesburg shows limited areas of higher density set around a downtown that no longer has a residential population, in the midst of a very low-density sprawl. Istanbul, New York and Hong Kong show how topographical constraints drive densities that rise to \u2018spikes\u2019 in Manhattan and parts of the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens in New York, and in Hong Kong Island and Kowloon in Hong Kong. S\u00e3o Paulo is multi-centred and similar in its overall density pattern to Mexico City, yet S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s skyline is dominated by high-rise apartment blocks, while Mexico City\u2019s is consistently low-rise, demonstrating that high-density can be achieved with different types of built form.<\/p>\n<h3>Signs of ageing<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"\/files\/2011\/11\/2011_chw_2050_02.gif\" rel=\"lightbox\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1002\" title=\"2011_chw_2050_02\" src=\"\/files\/2011\/11\/2011_chw_2050_02.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"1092\" height=\"1221\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The age distribution among urban populations reveals a considerable variation that closely mirrors national and global demographic trends. Hong Kong, along with European and North American cities, reflects a more mature average age compared to cities in developing countries, even though New York and London have younger populations than rural areas in the US and UK respectively. These cities reveal a \u2018middle-age spread\u2019 in line with declining birth rates and longer life expectancy. The story is different in contexts of rapid urban growth. The age pyramids of Mumbai and Mexico City \u2013 and to some extent Istanbul and S\u00e3o Paulo \u2013 show the dominance of younger rural-to-urban migrants, with many residents below the age of 30 providing a broad base for the labour force and the large informal sector they work in. Shanghai graphically represents the ageing structure of its population, reflecting China\u2019s one-child policy and heavy in-migration from rural areas. The remarkable drop in life expectancy, especially among men, of people above the age of 50\u201360 is noticeable in Mumbai, Istanbul and Johannesburg, indicating limited access to health care, high levels of poverty and poor environmental quality.<\/p>\n<h3>Infrastructures of Mobility<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"\/files\/2011\/11\/2011_chw_2050_03.gif\" rel=\"lightbox\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1003\" title=\"2011_chw_2050_03\" src=\"\/files\/2011\/11\/2011_chw_2050_03.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"1089\" height=\"1248\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Transport infrastructure is a critical driver of urban form, enabling the centralisation of economic functions and the accommodation of a growing population. Without public transport, space-hungry motorways dominate, resulting in more sprawl and congestion. The oldest and most extensive metro, bus and rail systems are in London and New York, creating high levels of accessibility. Hong Kong\u2019s younger metro network extends to approximately 250 kilometres (155 miles) through ten lines with further extensions underway, connecting new towns to the CBD. Like Hong Kong, Mumbai and Istanbul are constrained by topography and have developed efficient and affordable public transport. S\u00e3o Paulo and Mexico City, which are not geographically constrained, have allowed the car to dominate, even though Mexico City\u2019s 177 kilometres (110 miles) of metro carries as many passengers daily as London\u2019s 402 kilometres (250 miles). Shanghai is investing heavily in metro and rail transport, while Johannesburg has insufficient affordable public transport and relies heavily \u2013 as do S\u00e3o Paulo and Mexico City \u2013 on informal and unregulated collective taxis and mini bus services. Despite the recent addition of the Gautrain, Johannesburg\u2019s rudimentary transport system fails to connect to the places where most people live.<\/p>\n<h3>How people travel<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"\/files\/2011\/11\/2011_chw_2050_04.gif\" rel=\"lightbox\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1004\" title=\"2011_chw_2050_04\" src=\"\/files\/2011\/11\/2011_chw_2050_04.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"1083\" height=\"1242\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>How people travel within cities reflects the provision of public transport, local economic development, climate and urban form. Public transport accounts for 40 and 50 per cent respectively of all trips in London and Hong Kong, and 60 per cent of work trips in New York. In Hong Kong, nearly 45 per cent of trips are made on foot which, together with high public transport rates, gives it the greenest modal split of Urban Age cities in the developed world. Despite differing economic profiles, nearly as many people drive in Johannesburg as they do in London, reflecting the dearth of any form of affordable public transport system in the South African city. A third of all trips in S\u00e3o Paulo and Mexico City are made by private car, but just 6 per cent in Mumbai. Non-motorised transport rises in less developed, dense cities: 45 per cent of trips are on foot in Istanbul, and in Mumbai and Shanghai more than half are on foot or bicycle. Shanghai has experienced rapid growth in public transport use, while cycling remains prevalent (despite having dropped dramatically and being banned from some central streets): a feat not achieved by any other UA city. Even where there is a good metro system like in Mexico City, informal transport often dominates, reflecting a mismatch between travel patterns and infrastructure as well as the relatively high cost of public transport.<\/p>\n<h3>Urban Age cities compared<\/h3>\n<p>Behind the statistics of global city growth lie very different patterns of urbanisation, with diverse spatial, social and economic characteristics that dramatically affect the urban experience. In addition to standard measures of population growth and density, the economy and transport use, LSE Cities has assembled data from a range of official sources on energy consumption, global CO2 emissions and health, allowing a preliminary assessment of how these nine world cities compare to each other on key performance indicators.<br \/> A graphic summary of these results offers some striking differences, especially when it comes to their speed of growth. While S\u00e3o Paulo has grown nearly 8,000 per cent since 1900 and London by only 16 per cent (having experienced its major growth spurt in the previous century), it is Mumbai that is predicted to grow the fastest of the nine, with 44 additional residents each hour by 2025. London, however, will only gain one person per hour, Johannesburg three and Hong Kong seven. These trends mask different patterns of age distribution: close to a third of the residents of Mumbai, Johannesburg, S\u00e3o Paulo and Mexico City are under the age of 20, while in Shanghai and Hong Kong the younger generations shrink to 20 per cent or less. Patterns of habitation also differ significantly. The populations of Hong Kong and London are very similar in size, but the population densities within a 10-kilometre (6-mile) radius from their geographical centres (Tsim Sha Tsui, Kowloon in Hong Kong and Trafalgar Square in London) differ by a factor of three. Shanghai\u2019s central area density is as high as Hong Kong\u2019s, but drops off sharply beyond a 10-kilometre (6-mile) radius, while Hong Kong remains dense across the built-up urban region.<br \/> Of all the Urban Age cities, Hong Kong possesses the lowest murder rate, of less than one homicide per 100,000 inhabitants a year: safer even than Istanbul and Mumbai with less than three each. S\u00e3o Paulo, Johannesburg and Mexico City prove to be the more dangerous places to live \u2013 ranging from 13 to 21 murders per 100,000 people. With the exception of Hong Kong, these findings are paralleled by the level of income inequality indicated by the Gini coefficient \u2013 a measure of income distribution with a higher number representing greater inequality \u2013 in each of these cities: Johannesburg, S\u00e3o Paulo and Mexico City are the most unequal cities, followed closely by New York, with London being the most equitable. Hong Kong is the exception, being the only city that is both unequal and safe.<br \/> GDP per capita is highest in the global cities of London and New York (US$60,831 and US$55,693 respectively), followed by Hong Kong (US$45,090). People living in these three cities are many times wealthier, on average, than in other Urban Age cities such as Istanbul and S\u00e3o Paulo (US$ 12,000\u201313,000) and Johannesburg, Shanghai and Mumbai (less than US$10,000). Yet despite the fact that Mexico City\u2019s per capita income is less than a third of New Yorkers\u2019 (US$18,321 versus US$55,693), residents of Mexico City own nearly twice as many cars (360 per 1,000 people versus 209) and use roughly the same amount of water per person as Londoners (324 litres\/570 pints per day). While Johannesburg, London, Hong Kong and Mexico City contribute similar levels of CO2 emissions per person, the number doubles in Shanghai, where more than 10,000 kilograms (22,046 lb) per person are produced every year, owing to the presence of heavy manufacturing industry in its vast metropolitan region. In contrast we can see Istanbul, with close to 38 per cent of its workforce in the manufacturing sector, the highest of the Urban Age cities, producing just 2,720 kilograms (5,996 lb) of CO2 per person, while Mumbai\u2019s residents contribute only 371 kilogram (818 lb) per person \u2013 less than 10 per cent of that of residents in other global cities.<br \/> There is significant variation in life expectancy among the Urban Age cities, reflecting a multitude of factors, including the quality of health infrastructure, effectiveness of national public health policies as well as environmental and social conditions. On average, a Hong Konger lives 30 years longer than a resident of Johannesburg and still ten years longer than a person who is brought up in Istanbul or Sao Paulo, while residents of Shanghai can expect to live three years longer than New Yorkers. In Mumbai, although life expectancy has not yet reached 70 years, it performs well compared to the national average of 62 years.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"\/files\/2011\/11\/Urban-Age-Cities-Compared-Chart.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-908\" title=\"Urban Age Cities Compared Chart\" src=\"\/files\/2011\/11\/Urban-Age-Cities-Compared-Chart.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"4478\" height=\"2186\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":null,"article_publishing_date":"November 2011","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"169","name":"LSE","created":"2012-01-12 16:05:37","modified":"2012-01-12 17:15:59","slug":null,"family_name":"Cities","title":null,"email_address":null,"photo_legacy":null,"profile_text":null,"organization":null,"role":null,"additional_affiliations":null,"qualifications":null,"staff_pages_blurb":null,"office_location":null,"display_after":null,"display_until":null,"extended_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb_lang2":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation_lang2":null,"phone_number":null}],"attachments":false,"gallery":{"slug":false,"extra_classes":"","slides":[]}},{"request_language":"","current_page_uri":"\/media\/search-dev.json","lang2_slug":false,"lang2_name":false,"parent_publication_id":1,"featured_image_uri":"","article_title":"Urban Age City Survey","permalink":"urban-age-city-survey","article_subtitle":"","article_abstract":"","article_summary":"","article_text":"","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":"http:\/\/v0.urban-age.net\/0_downloads\/archive\/_SA\/10_NewsPaper_Essay_Oliveira-Page.pdf","article_publishing_date":"December 2008","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"48","name":"Luci","created":"2011-10-11 19:59:11","modified":"2011-10-11 20:59:11","slug":null,"family_name":"Oliveira","title":null,"email_address":null,"photo_legacy":null,"profile_text":"","organization":"","role":"","additional_affiliations":null,"qualifications":null,"staff_pages_blurb":null,"office_location":null,"display_after":null,"display_until":null,"extended_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb_lang2":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation_lang2":null,"phone_number":null},{"id":"49","name":"Ben","created":"2011-10-11 19:59:21","modified":"2011-10-11 20:59:21","slug":null,"family_name":"Page","title":null,"email_address":null,"photo_legacy":null,"profile_text":"","organization":"","role":"","additional_affiliations":null,"qualifications":null,"staff_pages_blurb":null,"office_location":null,"display_after":null,"display_until":null,"extended_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb_lang2":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation_lang2":null,"phone_number":null}],"attachments":false,"gallery":{"slug":false,"extra_classes":"","slides":[]}},{"request_language":"","current_page_uri":"\/media\/search-dev.json","lang2_slug":false,"lang2_name":false,"parent_publication_id":19,"featured_image_uri":"","article_title":"Urban Development in Maputo","permalink":"urban-development-in-maputo","article_subtitle":"Strategic Action Planning on a Tight Budget","article_abstract":"","article_summary":"","article_text":"<p>Maputo is the capital of Mozambique and, together with neighbouring Matola, the city conurbation currently has some 2.5 million inhabitants and is projected to grow to more than four million by 2025. It is one of the 15 largest urban areas in sub-Saharan Africa and, like other cities in the region, it is expanding beyond its formal boundaries and likely has a substantially higher population than the official figures suggest. Much of this population lives in informal or unplanned settlements, located in areas prone to floods or erosion, along highways and railway lines or beside polluting industries. The health implications of these conditions are detrimental.<br \/> But unplanned urban sprawl was not always an issue in Mozambique. A programme from the 1980s, Strategic Action Planning\u2019, used land redistribution to control housing demand, curb unplanned urban expansion and, in so doing, created desirable and equitable urban form. Thousands of plots were provided by the new local authority to citizens regardless of income. This reallocation of land for urban development had a substantial impact on metropolitan growth patterns and resulted in a far different experience than that of many other African cities that experienced unplanned, explosive urban growth. Assessing urban development and planning in Maputo over the past two decades leaves no doubt that the organised land division pioneered in the 1980s and the moderate densities which resulted have contributed to improved health in these areas. This suggests that physical planning can have an impact on health \u2013 if it is the right sort \u2013 and that it can be achieved with low budgets if accompanied by political will and strategic vision.<\/p>\n<h3>Why and how strategic action planning emerged in Maputo<\/h3>\n<p>In many African countries, colonial governments supplied plots for self-help housing. The Portuguese government, however, ignored this in Mozambique until the late 1960s, when the battle for independence heated up. With independence, accelerated in-migration to Maputo initially took place without any type of formal housing supply to meet increasing demand. People took advantage of the relaxed authority after years of government control, and unplanned and informal development began to mushroom, as it did in much of the \u2018developing world\u2019. Although post-independence Mozambique had hardly any qualified architects and planners and urban development was not a priority of the new government, nonetheless an urban development team was built up within the Greater Maputo city council from 1980.<br \/> As in other parts of Africa, these professionals subscribed to the dominant international strategies of the time like organised \u2018self-help\u2019 housing and \u2018sites and services\u2019 schemes. However, in Maputo severely constrained local budgets were compensated by nationalised land, and hence a strategic programme of land distribution was developed. The strategy was to get ahead of urbanisation by focusing on pro-active land control, thus permitting the consolidation of urban development to happen over time through actual demand. This approach resulted from a specific decision not to continue with the relatively costly urban upgrading pilot project, which the national government and the UN had implemented in the immediately preceding period (1977\u20139).<br \/> The Strategic Action Planning programme managed to provide approximately 12,000 plots, organised in neighbourhood clusters with land reserved for roads, schools, health posts and recreation, over a six-year period from 1981. At the time, approximately 300,000 inhabitants lived in unplanned settlements around the formal central urban core, while the new plots had a planned capacity of just 60,000 people. The layouts were simple, motivated by the need for fast demarcation and the limited technical capacity within the municipal authorities. A key accompanying element was land-use control and construction advice provided through an extension service of basically trained technicians, or \u2018bare-foot planners\u2019, as well as a subsidised basic sanitation programme aimed at improving health conditions, which eventually became a UN Habitat Best Practice.<\/p>\n<h3>Managing rapid urban expansion in Maputo today<\/h3>\n<p>Back in the twenty-first Century, rapid urban expansion continues, but this time outside of Maputo\u2019s official boundaries. In recent years, international agencies, notably UN Habitat through its Cities without Slums initiative, have once again refocused their attentions on slum upgrading projects, rather than on curbing unplanned urban expansion. Rapid urban expansion continued through the 1990s up until the present day. Like so many other \u2018developing countries\u2019 with a limited urban budget the national and local governments find themselves in a state of never-ending upgrades, with little political will or funding to prevent sprawl in the first place. Recent pilot slum upgrading projects showed only marginal positive impacts given the momentum of urban expansion underway both through the densification of inner city areas and through the urbanisation of new land on the periphery.<br \/> In light of the limited administrative and financial capacity of Maputo\u2019s city government to sub-divide plots formally, today plots are increasingly provided by small and medium informal suppliers, typically long-term residents claiming traditional land rights. These residents sub-divide plots in a similar way as was pioneered by the state in the 1980s. Maputo\u2019s pioneering Strategic Action Planning approach now continues as a cultural model within society, with many poor and better-off residents seeing the original master plan, 30 years later, as an ideal urban form, but with one major difference. A shift from public to private providers of land distribution highlights an unwillingness to provide land for public open spaces or spaces for social amenities such as schools and health clinics. No private developer sees any interest in setting aside land that cannot be immediately capitalised.<br \/> In addition, it has become much easier for private interests to dominate the needs and rights of existing residents of informal settlements, especially in cases where settlements are located on prime land. On top of the direct and quite hazardous living conditions facing residents daily, the legal right to hold the land where they often have lived over generations may be under threat. As fewer and fewer sites become available for development in central locations of Maputo, the informal areas bordering the city have come now under pressure and developers are increasingly buying out local residents at prices way below the market value. This development is apparently being welcomed by the city authorities which, in one case, shelved a project developed by the Faculty of Architecture in Maputo based on participatory and inclusive approaches. An alternative plan engaging the private sector envisages demolishing all of the houses to give way for commercial development, condominiums and social housing. The private sector will buy out the informal settlers and over time fulfil the plan now in process of being approved. The residents will be pushed to the periphery or end up in other informal settlements under severely overcrowded conditions. However, local resistance is building up and eventually the implementation of the plan may run into difficulties.<\/p>\n<h3>Towards an urbanism from below<\/h3>\n<p>The experiences of Maputo show that it is time to reconsider the merits of planning approaches which actually work in producing the liveable and more healthy urban environments that residents aspire to, rather than attempt to realise the unachievable norms of what governments, private interests and global institutions think are appropriate. This is not based in a romantic attitude towards self-help and informal settlements as exotic urban environments, but rather a pragmatic recognition of a form of emergent endogenous urbanism. Such a form of urbanism suggests a different modernity. While Mozambican urban residents do aspire to some of the forms of modernity which are planned and designed by architects, their aspirations are embedded in context, unlike most of the formal plans and urban development projects proposed by professionals. In light of the continued relative weakness of the state and private sector in the face of rapid urbanisation and widespread low income levels, what is needed most now is a professional openness to alternative modernities and forms of urban development which are based on contextual demand.<br \/> The Maputo experience of people-oriented urban development from the 1980s still shows how a strategic, low-cost and hands-on approach to the reality of a rapidly expanding urban setting can produce significant results, particularly in relation to urban health. Rapid urban growth in African countries alongside high levels of poverty requires active planning with people and not planning for people. While the present context, and hence the means of operation, for this will be different from that of the 1980s, the goal still must be to move beyond limited pilot projects, typically funded by international agencies and implemented by non-governmental organisations, and instead engage with the \u2018informal\u2019 practices of urban land development and construction in informal settlements, while guiding such practices to ensure social and cultural aspirations are healthy, inclusive and self-managing. Arguably, the era of top-down planning is ending and here Africa can provide new models for people-based urban development.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/11\/2011_chw_5070_EskemoseAndersen-Jenking.pdf","article_publishing_date":"November 2011","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"132","name":"J\u00f8rgen Eskemose","created":"2011-11-04 11:41:52","modified":"2013-10-22 22:31:46","slug":"andersen-jorgen-eskemose","family_name":"Andersen","title":"","email_address":"","photo_legacy":"","profile_text":"J\u00f8rgen Eskemose Andersen is Architect\/ Planner and Associate Professor and Head of Department of Human Settlements at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts, School of Architecture, in Copenhagen.

Meanwhile, urban areas occupy just 5 per cent of the earth. Although high urban density can bring many benefits, it should not be forgotten that high population densities, and the resultant concentration of wealth in tiny spots around the globe, increases risk exposure to these places. In recent years, natural disasters have increased both in severity and frequency related to climate change, and cities not traditionally associated with such disasters are now facing increased risk. Simultaneously, because of densities of infrastructure that accompany rapid urbanisation, the complexity of disasters, such as the combination of floods, power plant or factory accidents and hazards, can be triggered by the same natural disaster. The application of new risk-management policies seems to be an urgent matter as cities accelerate their growth, and given the demographic momentum of an urban transition.<\/p>\n<p>The Tokyo Metropolitan Area, composed of the capital city, Tokyo, and the surrounding three prefectures, is known as the largest metropolitan area in the world, with a population of 35 million and a GDP of US$1,479 billion. Although the historical cityscape was mostly demolished during World War II, the fundamental structure of Tokyo remained with its unique urban form centralised around the Imperial Palace. Modern infrastructure, such as railways and motorways, were transferred onto this urban form, and it is because of these systems that a huge number of people can live, move and work in Tokyo. Life expectancy at birth for males is 73 years and for females 78 years, which are among the highest figures in the world. The number of murders in Tokyo per million people in 2010 was 7.7, a very low rate among other global cities. With these facts in mind, Tokyo\u2019s well-being could be measured as one of the highest in the world. Meanwhile, the city has been facing severe disasters like the Great Kanto earthquake that struck in 1923, as well as more routine typhoons and floods. There have been significant losses caused by these disasters; however, because of their consistency, risk-management policies have accumulated over time.<\/p>\n<p>The complex disaster on 11 March 2011 caused by the earthquake in east Japan, and subsequently the tsunami and damage to the Fukushima nuclear plant, also had an effect on the city. In Tokyo, 400 kilometres (248 miles) away from the M9 earthquake, the shock was rated a 5+ out of a total of 7 under the measurement system used in Japan. And yet, only ten houses collapsed and seven people died. This seemingly limited amount of damage points to the massive set of improvements in the seismic performance of buildings that were put into place following the Great Hanshin-Awaji earthquake in 1995. Also, because of the \u2018my-com-meter\u2019, a system introduced post-1995 to shut down residential gas supply at the first sense of an earthquake, there were no fires in the city. Bridges, motorways and railways have also had considerable reinforcement over the past decade, and so were not seriously damaged. Tokyo in 2011 offers us some visible success of several risk-management policies that have been refined over the past century, and specifically within the past 15 years.<\/p>\n<p>However, while no major infrastructural damage or large numbers of deaths occurred, Tokyoites still faced serious inconveniences, particularly those who rely on the highly developed urban infrastructure in the centre of the city.<\/p>\n<p>The earthquake struck around 3pm. Since there was little damage to the city, people assumed that they would be able to get home as usual. Tokyo has one of the most sophisticated train systems in the world, moving some ten million people daily. However, following the quake, all the lines were systematically shut down in order to monitor for any possible damage. Some 40 per cent of the lines, mostly subways, recovered within the day. But the rest were kept shut until the following day. This unprecedented shut-down saw the city\u2019s streets overflowing with people. Major terminals, such as Tokyo Station and Shinjuku Station, which usually accommodate more than 1.5 million passengers every day, closed. Consequently, people had to take what transport they could, with many walking for several hours back to their homes. Some bought and rode bicycles, others were picked up by car by a family member, still more went back to the office, or stayed at the refugee centres that were set up in the city\u2019s public facilities and shopping centres. While things remained calm and organised, the lines of walking people did not disappear until the early morning. This experience made explicit the risks of a Metropolitan Region dependant on daily long-distance commuting.<\/p>\n<p>The other inconvenience Tokyo faced was as a result of the impact of the tsunami on the nuclear plant at Fukushima. The plant shut down, creating electricity shortages, and resulting in reduced train frequency on each transit line and the closure of barrier-free transit infrastructure such as escalators and lifts. Because of these events, the mobility of elderly people and families with small children was significantly reduced. In response, the government ordered a reduction in domestic electricity use, which had the result of, among other things, decreased temperature control. Furthermore, because of the disaster, people began to stock up on supplies. In particular, people rushed to purchase bottled water, even though the official radiation levels in Tokyo\u2019s water supply showed no signs of being harmful to humans. As a result there was less clean water available to those most vulnerable to radiation poisoning, such as infants. So, even though the infrastructure of the city survived, the social and economic materiality of city living was proven to be fragile, and with mobility and health vulnerabilities increased among the elderly and the young, many Tokyoites lost confidence in a city that traditionally has a very high quality of life.<\/p>\n<p>Over the next few years, urban practitioners, disaster-management experts and risk-assessment professionals will actively be responding to the lessons learnt from the events of March 2011. For example, one outlier was Roppongi Hills, one of the recent major urban development projects in the heart of Tokyo. It was not affected by the disaster at all. During the shut-down of the city\u2019s public infrastructures, it was able to offer support to people who were not able to go home by providing ample stocks of food, water and blankets. Shocks to the area\u2019s high-rise buildings, such as the Mori Tower, were reduced by \u2018Dumping Devices\u2019, which meant that operations were back to usual the following day. Because the complex had its own LNG (liquefied natural gas) plant, it was free from the ensuing electricity shortage and was even able to provide electricity to the surrounding areas.<\/p>\n<p>While Roppongi Hills can provide several best practice lessons, and is the largest private based development in Tokyo, it is a relatively small area compared to the whole Metropolitan Region. However, risk-management policies are now developing in order to implement the lessons learnt here, to Tokyo as a whole. Forecasts show that there is a 70 per cent chance of a great earthquake occurring in or near Tokyo within the next 30 years; therefore, just like after the earthquake in 1995, urban systems need to continue to implement risk-management policies.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/11\/2011_chw_5057_Kubo.pdf","article_publishing_date":"November 2011","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"139","name":"Takayuki","created":"2011-11-04 17:30:59","modified":"2011-11-04 17:30:59","slug":null,"family_name":"Kubo","title":null,"email_address":null,"photo_legacy":null,"profile_text":null,"organization":null,"role":null,"additional_affiliations":null,"qualifications":null,"staff_pages_blurb":null,"office_location":null,"display_after":null,"display_until":null,"extended_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb_lang2":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation_lang2":null,"phone_number":null}],"attachments":false,"gallery":{"slug":false,"extra_classes":"","slides":[]}},{"request_language":"","current_page_uri":"\/media\/search-dev.json","lang2_slug":false,"lang2_name":false,"parent_publication_id":11,"featured_image_uri":"","article_title":"Urban Spaces In and Around Istanbul","permalink":"urban-spaces-in-and-around-istanbul","article_subtitle":"","article_abstract":"<p>Murat G\u00fcven\u00e7 and Eda Y\u00fccesoy offer a historical overview of how Istanbul\u2019s urban configuration has been shaped by decades of demands for new housing and services.<\/p>\n","article_summary":"","article_text":"<p>To start with a few facts and figures, with 15 million the population of Istanbul and its emerging city region is one of the largest in South-East Europe. Geographically situated on two narrow peninsulas separated by the Bosporus, the northern shores of either landmass are covered by ecologically sensitive forests, water catchments and reservoirs vital to the future of the city. Because of these physical barriers, a major part of the population lives in a linear band approximately 100 kilometres long and 20 kilometres wide. Hence Istanbul has a population comparable to that of the Netherlands concentrated in less than 10 per cent of its surface area. The greater metropolitan region of Istanbul accounts for slightly more than 20 per cent of the national population, while the city generates 40 per cent of value added and approximately 50 per cent of the tax revenues of the entire country. Thus, the most significant part of Turkey\u2019s economic activity, the manufacturing of goods and services, as well as its social life and artistic creation, all take place in this tiny north-western corner of the country.<\/p>\n<p>It would be difficult to convince a contemporary visitor impressed by the size, density, dynamism, and congestion of the cityscape that only six decades ago, Istanbul was a forgotten and stagnant port city with less than one million residents cut off from world trade. The recent history of the city, however, sheds light on the dark side of Istanbul\u2019s obscure and intractable socio-spatial formation. As is the case in many peripheral countries, the end of World War II constituted a major turning point in the social history of Turkey and Istanbul. In spite of notable efforts to industrialise, Turkey\u2019s economy was basically agricultural. Urban residents accounted for less than 20 per cent of the population, and the bulk of its imports were financed by exports of semi-processed agricultural products along with a handful of raw materials and minerals.<\/p>\n<p>In the 1960s a new regime of accumulation forbade investments in non-productive sectors such as housing and urban utilities, and instead gave incentives for domestic production. The underlying belief was that Turkey would solve its urbanisation problem and develop only if it industrialised. As expected, stopping all investments in urban infrastructure and metropolitan transport had important repercussions on the urban fabric of Istanbul. In addition, increasing land prices and unaffordable rents made housing of the emerging middle classes a major issue. Likewise the new regime was silent about \u2013 even blind to \u2013 how new residents should be housed. Unable to find formal solutions, these two groups of residents created ad-hoc solutions that now constitute the distinctive features of the urban fabric in and around Istanbul.<\/p>\n<p>For the new middle classes, the approach consisted of transforming former detached single-family dwellings into apartment blocks. Landowners were not paid in advance but were instead compensated per apartment unit, depending on the level of the land and the rent. This significantly lowered the initial capital required for development and resulted in the ubiquitous four- to five-storey walk-ups constructed in the early 1960s and 1970s. These developments were carried out by small-scale entrepreneurs targeting middle- and higher-income groups in highly sought-after and comparatively well-serviced parts of the city.<\/p>\n<p>Newcomers, on the other hand, built gecekondu (literally \u2018built overnight\u2019) on irregularly subdivided \u2018private\u2019 property. Informal housing in Istanbul took place on small parcels of land, irrespective of topography, in back-to-back building blocks on narrow streets according to the orthogonal street grid. The provisions and quality of services improved over time in the gecekondu. Water, for example, was initially a major issue. Supplied through public fountains or municipal tanks, water supply developed into a cottage industry that provided jobs for the unemployed. Sewage issues were solved through septic tanks or local streams. With its unplanned high density, the urban infrastructure in the gecekondu was certainly significantly low. Water supply was intermittent and the quality generally failed to meet the minimum requirements set by the World Health Organization. Power cuts were also frequent. The chronic lack of investment by service providers forced residents to devise their own solutions by adding water tanks and pumps.<\/p>\n<p>To enhance its control over urban space, the new regime introduced unprecedented reform devised to regulate former squatter housing. This form of building amnesty occurred following the 1984 municipal elections and regularised all irregular constructions and add-ons, regardless of their size and building conditions. It provided security of tenure for a period of transition and a formal land title that had an immediate and significant impact on urban processes and land tenure systems.<\/p>\n<p>Endowed with new discretionary and planning powers, as well as significantly higher revenues, the newly established Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality was capable of massive investment in urban infrastructure, metropolitan utilities and mass transit systems. With telecommunications being privatised, it was possible to have a phone connection within a week, whereas as recently as the 1970s it would have taken years. The new liberal regime reduced customs barriers and introduced preferential credit schemes for house buyers and passed new laws encouraging capital-intensive mass production in the housing sector. Due to the availability of long-term credit, large-scale investments in urban infrastructure enabled developers \u2013 the new actors in the city\u2019s housing sector \u2013 to construct housing complexes at metropolitan fringes. The days of the petty producers were over.<\/p>\n<p>In this new economic climate and era of new municipal governance, the city decentralised at an unprecedented speed. Decentralisation of the population went hand in hand with that of jobs, services, and shopping facilities. The inauguration of the second bridge over the Bosporus facilitated the northward decentralisation of the central business district. Systematic disinvestments and privatisation of state enterprises led to significant losses in the manufacturing sector and factories on the Golden Horn shores. Along the Bosporus these spaces were transformed to create new uses and jobs in the cultural industries. And as is the case in most global cities, the rise of the service economy created a minority of well-paid executives in finance and services.<\/p>\n<p>Although Istanbul still has a substantive stock of squatter houses, shared taxis and street vendors, it is no longer a city of squatters. It has been replaced by a new global city for which we urgently need a metaphor. The map below charts the contiguous growth processes that were instrumental in its formation. Thus the socio-spatial structures of former decades can be used as matrices or incubators for an emerging global city. As the Istanbul metropolitan region that is emerging around the new Marmaray mass transit system is constructed, we do not yet know how the city\u2019s growth will evolve. But we do know that we have a vast urban age to discuss and reflect on its differences.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_745\" style=\"width: 958px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-745\" title=\"15_00\" src=\"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/11\/15_00.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"948\" height=\"717\" \/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">This map charts the city\u2019s growth according to the date of construction of residential buildings.

With the following article I wish to stimulate a conversation between urban planning, architecture and neuroscience, in the hope of facilitating a more nuanced understanding of how urban and rural living conditions differentially impact upon our mental health. At a first glance, there are enormous methodological differences between the disciplines of urban planning and neuroscience. Nonetheless, considering the neuroscientific approach to the topic of cities is essential, as from it we can start to understand how city living affects inhabitants\u2019 brain biology and could therefore influence the risk for developing mental disorders. On the bright side, there are also indicators that show a protective aspect of large cities with regards to mental health. Cities, therefore, may lend themselves to facilitating new and appropriate health intervention strategies.<\/p>\n<p>Urban living is on the rise whereas rural living is becoming the exception \u2013 in all parts of the world and at an ever-increasing rate. The rapid pace of urbanisation is an important marker of the societal transition at large that has occurred over the past 30 years. Our world is shifting towards an urban, small-family or single household, and at the same time, an ageing society. In the next 30 years we will be faced with the growing challenges specific to our cities\u2019 aged single urban populations.<\/p>\n<p>But urban living is not only about getting older, it is also about getting stressed. Stress is the unspecific physiological and psychological reaction to perceived threats to our physical, psychological or social integrity. And urban living can be threatening if you haven\u2019t enough space of your own, if you experience insufficient security or live under unstable economic conditions. Stress increases with the anticipation of adverse situations and the fear of not having the adequate resources to respond to them. From an evolutionary point of view, stress is the mechanism that prepares us for any &#8216;fight-or-flight&#8217; reaction, and also causes us to evolve in order to better adapt to our environment. Although not harmful per se, stress may jeopardise our health when stress exposure is chronic or when complete recovery is not possible.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong>Stress-related health consequences<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>What does stress do to the body? Our organism has two major hormonal stress systems, the quick responding (within milliseconds) autonomic nervous system, which controls the release of noradrenaline and adrenaline, and the somewhat slower hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) system, which is responsible for the release of cortisol, the &#8216;stress hormone&#8217;. Roughly speaking, the quick system prepares us to react immediately whereas the slow system\u2019s reaction depends on the perceived danger of the situation. Noradrenaline and adrenaline increase the heart rate and decrease the heart rate variability, dilate the respiratory airways and activate blood platelets to coagulate. Cortisol antagonises insulin and thus, under certain conditions of persistent stress-dependent dysregulation of the HPA system, results in a diabetes-like metabolic situation. It restructures body fat, promotes obesity, suppresses the immune system and may have a toxic effect on neurons in certain brain regions, particularly the hippocampus, which is important for memory functions. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Repeated exposure to social stress in rats leads to abnormal processing of the so-called &#8216;TAU protein&#8217; in the hippocampus, a mechanism that plays an important role in the development of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Stress also leads to the shortening of the &#8216;protection caps&#8217; at both ends of our chromosomes, called telomeres. At the same time, stress also weakens the enzyme responsible for repairing these protection caps. When the telomeres get too short the cell can no longer divide and the tissue loses its regeneration capacity. The result is premature ageing of the organism.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Urban living and mental health<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Living in an urban environment is long known to be a risk factor for psychiatric diseases such as major depression or schizophrenia. This is true even though infrastructure, socioeconomic conditions, nutrition and health care services are clearly better in cities than in rural areas. Higher stress exposure and higher stress vulnerability seem to play a crucial role. Social stress may be the most important factor for the increased risk of mental disorders in urban areas. It may be experienced as social evaluative threat, or as chronic social stress, both of which are likely to occur as a direct consequence of high population densities in cities. As for the impact on mental health, social stress seems to outweigh other urban stressors such as pollution or noise. Living in crowded areas is associated with increased social stress, since the environment becomes less controllable for the individual. Social disparities also become much more prominent in cities and can impose stress on the individual. Further, disturbance of chronobiological rhythmsis is more frequent in cities than in rural areas and has a negative influence on mental health and beyond. A recent meta-analysis showed that urban dwellers have a 20 per cent higher risk of developing anxiety disorders, and a 40 per cent higher risk of developing mood disorders. For schizophrenia, double the risk has been shown, with a &#8216;dose-response&#8217; relationship for urban exposure and disease risk. Longitudinal studies on patients with schizophrenia indicate that it is urban living and upbringing per se, rather than other epidemiological variables, that increase the risk for mental disorders.<\/p>\n<p>As urbanisation of our world is inevitable, we urgently need to improve our understanding of the threatening \u2013 as well as the health protective \u2013 factors of urban living. Evidence is beginning to surface that indicates that the urban population shows a stronger brain response to stress, and stronger cognitive impairment under stress. A recent fMRI study in the journal <em>Nature, <\/em>conducted by a German research group, showed that these effects seem to occur irrespective of age, gender, general health status, marital or income status. In this study, the amygdala (a brain region that regulates emotions such as anxiety and fear) showed higher activation under stress in healthy individuals from large cities compared to their counterparts from rural regions. Interestingly, activation grew with the size of the current home city. Further, activity in another brain region associated with depression, the perigenual anteriour cingular cortex, was positively correlated with the time that an individual had spent in a large city as a child. The more years someone had spent growing up under urban conditions, the more active this brain region tended to be.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Urban stressors during childhood<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>There is an interesting finding against the converging evidence that adverse conditions in early life can severely impact the developing brain and increase vulnerability to mood disorders in adult life. It has been shown that adverse early-life events can alter the experience-dependent maturation of the stress systems, such as the HPA system. This again results in higher stress vulnerability later in life. Inducing early life stress in rodents (for example, by maternal separation) can result in persistent increase of anxiety-like behaviour and life-long hyperactivity of the HPA system in response to stress. Early-life stress may result in epigenetic changes, which means that the activity of certain genes is altered and may even be inherited by next generations. However, the majority of these studies focus on the effects of adverse experiences such as physical maltreatment, neglect or maternal separation, and not on urban stressors which may affect children\u2019s or parents\u2019 well-being (and therefore influence parental attachment). Thus, further research examining the long-term stress vulnerability effects of urban stressors during childhood is necessary.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Social stress in the city<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Another recent study has reported that the size of the amygdala correlates with the size and complexity of an individual\u2019s social network. Other studies have demonstrated the correlation of amygdala activity with the spatial distance between two individuals as well as with anticipated social decline (for example, as a consequence of separation or job loss). What consequence does this have for urban planning? What does that mean in terms of the stress resilience of an increasingly urban population? What are the health consequences of higher social stress exposure and stress vulnerability of urban dwellers, given that stress is the most likely pathophysiological cause of many mental disorders, particularly depression? And from a political perspective, what actions can be taken to protect people living under dense metropolitan conditions from stress and its negative mental impact?<\/p>\n<p>Our brains do not seem to be optimally designed for living under our generation\u2019s urban conditions, in the large, densely-populated metropolises of our world. However, there might be large inter-individual differences of stress vulnerability in an urban environment. For this reason, understanding more about stress-protective factors for city inhabitants might help us to plan appropriate public health strategies. If we assume that stress, most often of a social nature, is the major intermediate variable increasing the risk for mental disorders, then the focus needs to be on identifying and improving our understanding of the most health-threatening social stressors, and how these stressors translate into brain disorders. A look into basic stress research might help: studies show that lack of control, social threat and the fear of losing one\u2019s social status strongly contribute to experiencing stress. These factors have been shown to affect the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex. On the other hand, there is interesting converging evidence that proteins that increase social behaviour, so-called pro-social neuropeptides, like oxytocine, can modulate these brain regions. We therefore need to better understand how these social stressors &#8216;project&#8217; on urban populations under the conditions of city living, and under which conditions they overexcite the compensation and recovery potentials of the individual. How much, for example, does the subjective perception of an uncertain hierarchical order \u2013 a well-known social stressor \u2013 increase with population density, social disparity or housing conditions?<\/p>\n<p><strong>A look ahead<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Clearly, many inhabitants of large metropolitan areas do very well both in terms of health and life quality as they benefit from better infrastructure, and a more dense system of social, health care, cultural and educational options. So this leads us to ask, what are the biological, psychological and social prerequisites for healthy urban living? Answering this and other similar questions by means of neurobiological studies on stress promoting and stress protective variables will be invaluable in helping politicians, city planners and health authorities to plan a healthy urban environment.<\/p>\n<p>Extra risk may be associated with growing up in an urban area \u2013 as opposed to first living there as an adult \u2013 as stress vulnerability of the brain alters with age. The human brain has distinct periods of vulnerability. The neurobiological effects of experiencing urban stress in early childhood differ from those associated with the experience of urban stress later in life. Therefore, future studies should separate the impact of urban living on the maturing brain, and on the adult brain, and focus on if and how stress factors manifest under these conditions respective of one another, and in conjunction of one another.<\/p>\n<p>So many of us have left and are continuing to leave our rural environments. We seek the density of large cities for their variety of leisure activities, rich cultural life, better access to employment and anonymity; but this seems to come at a cost. We may be paying for it with our health.<\/p>\n<p>Can urban planners benefit from neuroscience? Of course, urban living has many different facets, which again may have a variety of consequences for mental health and well-being. And naturally, the layout of our cities does not project 1:1 on our neurobiology. Cities are complicated structures, and the human brain is an even more complicated organ. This is no good prerequisite for the formulation of simple &#8216;if-then&#8217; rules. Nonetheless, if major social stressors, such as certain aspects of population density and hazardous social gradients, are proven to be health-threatening, we should be able to moderate population exposure and have an impact on the urban population\u2019s \u2013 or perhaps better said, on the majority of humankind\u2019s \u2013 increased risk of mental health problems. We should bear in mind that these factors apply to cities of the Western world. The urban challenges in the megacities of middle- and low-income countries may vary as they bear greater challenges in terms of poverty, steep social gradients, poor hygienic standards and poor safety. These factors may impose additional and potentially stronger stressors on the population. The World Health Organization has highlighted stress as one of the major health challenges of the twenty-first century. Urban living is quickly developing as a major contributor to this. The challenge can, however, be tackled by joint action between life sciences, social sciences, urban planning, architecture and politics.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><strong><em><br \/> <\/em><\/strong><em><\/em><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/11\/2011_chw_4030_Adli.pdf","article_publishing_date":"November 2011","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"115","name":"Mazda","created":"2011-11-04 11:26:37","modified":"2012-06-25 00:37:44","slug":"adli-mazda","family_name":"Adli","title":null,"email_address":"","photo_legacy":"","profile_text":"","organization":"","role":"","additional_affiliations":"","qualifications":"","staff_pages_blurb":"","office_location":"","display_after":"","display_until":"","extended_blurb":"","special_2012ec_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb_lang2":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation_lang2":null,"phone_number":null}],"attachments":false,"gallery":{"slug":false,"extra_classes":"","slides":[]}},{"request_language":"","current_page_uri":"\/media\/search-dev.json","lang2_slug":false,"lang2_name":false,"parent_publication_id":10,"featured_image_uri":"","article_title":"Urban Transport in Indian Cities","permalink":"urban-transport-in-indian-cities","article_subtitle":"","article_abstract":"","article_summary":"","article_text":"<p><div id=\"attachment_143\" style=\"width: 658px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-143\" src=\"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/10\/DPA-RVA-0127.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"648\" height=\"421\" \/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">A peak of rush hour commuters at Churchgate, a terminus for one of Mumbai\u2019s main suburban train lines contributing to the nearly 6.5 million people feeding in and out of the city daily.<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Urban travel in Indian cities predominantly happens through walking, cycling and public transport, including intermediate public transport (IPT). Despite high growth rates of motorised two wheelers and cars in the last two decades (15 per cent and 10 per cent per annum respectively), car ownership remains at 3\u201313 per cent of the households and two wheelers at 40\u201350 per cent. The latter is same as the bicycle ownership in cities of different sizes. The variation in modal shares among these three seems to have a relationship between city size and per capita income. Small and medium size cities have a lower income than the mega cities. Therefore the dependence on cycle rickshaws and bicycles is higher in smaller cities. In some medium-size cities (populations of 1 million to 3 million), private buses have been introduced. Public-sector-run state transport corporations have been responsible for running inter-city routes. Other than the four megacities (Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata and Chennai) Bangalore and Pune are the exceptions in which municipal corporations have been running significant number of buses. Other cities have skeletal bus services provided by the city municipality. Intermediate public transport (IPT) modes like tempos, cars and cycle rickshaws assume importance as they are necessary to meet travel demands in medium size cities in India like Lucknow, Hubli, Varanasi, Kanpur and Vijayawada. These vehicles have minimal regulations in terms of road worthiness certifications issued by the transport authorities. Their operations have been left to the private operator. Often they have been found to cause serious emission and safety violations. However, there is no policy or project that can improve the operation of para-transit modes. Often the fare policy stipulated by the government is not honoured by the operators, and the road infrastructure also does not include facilities for these modes. As a result, the operators have to violate legal policies to survive.<\/p>\n<p>Of India\u2019s 285 million urban residents, nearly 100 million people live in urban slums. Travel patterns of people living in informal housing or slums are very different from residents in formal housing. Generally, cycling and walking account for 50 to 75 per cent of the commuter trips for those in the informal sector. The formal sector is dependent on buses, cars and two wheelers. This implies that despite high risks and a hostile infrastructure, low-cost modes exist because their users do not have any choice. They are the captive users of these modes. Public transport is the predominant mode of motorised travel in mega cities. Buses carry 20 to 65 per cent of the total amount of passengers excluding those who walk. The minimum cost of public transport use accounts for 20 to 30 per cent of the family income for nearly 50 per cent of the city population living in unauthorised settlements.<\/p>\n<p>Since transport is a state subject in the Indian constitution, central government did not have a policy or investment plan for urban transport infrastructure until 2006. City governments attempted to solve transport crises as isolated road improvement projects. Despite investments in road infrastructure and plans for land use and transport development, all cities continue to face the problem of congestion, traffic accidents and air and noise pollution. All these problems are on the increase. Investments in road-widening schemes and grade-separated junctions which primarily benefit personal vehicle users (cars and two wheelers) only, have dominated government expenditure. For example in Delhi, the total funds allocated for the transport sector in 2002\u20132003 have doubled in 2006\u20132007. However, 80 per cent of the funds have been allocated for road-widening schemes benefiting primarily the car and motorcycle users. In 2006\u20132007, 60 per cent of the funds have been earmarked for public transport, which primarily includes a metro system. Cars are owned by less than 15 per cent of the households in Delhi. Therefore, an investment in car-friendly infrastructure is not meant for a majority of the commuters.<\/p>\n<p>In the name of promoting public transport, demand for rail-based systems (metro, LRT and monorail) has been pursued by several cities. This is despite the fact that the rail-based systems are capital intensive; capacity is underutilised and the system requires capital and operating subsidies. The existing metro systems in Kolkata, Chennai and Delhi carry less than 20 per cent of the available capacity. All three systems are running with operating losses. Despite this the government in Delhi has decided to expand the metro system. Similarly the state governments of Maharashtra, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh have decided to invest in metro systems. These systems will cater for a small proportion of the total amount of journeys (less than five per cent). Yet they are being pursued by the city authorities and promoted as investment projects in which the private sector can participate. The Mumbai metro rail project has been approved as the first MRTS project being implemented as a public private partnership (PPP) project.<\/p>\n<p>Traffic and transport improvement proposals prepared by consultants before the JNNURM (Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission), include proposals for road widening, grade-separated junctions and metro systems. While the road-widening and junction-improvement schemes were implemented in only a few cities, public transport remained in the reports only because the finances required for metro projects are beyond the capacity of state or city governments.<\/p>\n<p>Different Indian cities are either implementing or looking at new public transport systems, be it a metro, high-capacity buses or a sky bus. The argument given for introducing new technologies is that they will serve the high-density demands expected on a few corridors in the city. In the last fifteen years, comprehensive traffic and transport plans have been made for at least twenty cities. Travel forecasts for the next 34 years have been used to justify the proposals for light rail or metro systems. Indian cities have high-density developments in the form of urban slums. Even a subsidised metro system is too expensive for slum dwellers. Cities have grown as multi-nucleated centres with mixed land-use patterns. Often formal and informal housing coexist, which in turn results in short journey lengths. This is one of the reasons why the demand for metro systems in Indian cities is low. Metro systems are capital-intensive systems (Rs.2,000-3,000 million\/km, or US$51\u201376 million\/km). It is not suitable to meet the mobility requirements of the majority of city residents. For the same price a 30\u201350 km bus network can be developed, including the use of modern buses. This would benefit 30 to 50 times more people than a metro system. The cost of a single metro trip is at least Rs.45 (US$1.14) compared to Rs.15 (US$0.38) for a bus trip. Since car and personal two wheelers provide a flexible door-to-door service, it is not easy to attract these users to a metro, even if they can afford the cost. Tickets have to be subsidised at least 10 to 15 times more heavily than a bus ticket for the same journey. All rail-based systems depend on buses, three wheelers and rickshaws as feeder modes to increase their catchment area. Only long-distance travellers (with journeys of at least 15 km) are likely to use a feeder mode. Therefore, in order to realise the social benefits of metro systems the city structure has to change completely.<\/p>\n<p>A draft national urban transport policy was introduced in 2004 and adopted in 2006. At the same time the national government introduced the Jawaharlal Nehru Urban Renewal Mission to upgrade the crumbling infrastructure of urban areas. Under JNNURM, the government of India has identified 63 cities for which it will provide assistance in upgrading its road infrastructure. Detailed guidelines have been provided to ensure that public transport gets priority in these cities. For getting approval for transport projects, the guidelines recommend that the transport infrastructure improvement schemes are in compliance with the NUTP (National Urban Transport Policy). Since NUTP\u2019s focus is public transport, pedestrians and bicycles, cities are modifying the earlier road expansion projects to Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) and bicycle-inclusive plans. BRT and bicycle-inclusive plans have been approved by the central government for five cities and another five cities are at different stages of preparation. It seems that pedestrian and bicycle facilities are not the focus of these projects. In six-lane arterial roads, two lanes are reserved for public transport buses, although there is a reluctance to provide quality facility for pedestrians and cyclists. This is reflected in the priority for space allocation for various modes in a restricted right of way. In order to accommodate two lanes for cars and an exclusive lane for buses, pedestrians and cyclists have been given less than desirable space. This is despite the fact that nearly 50 per cent trips are made on foot, by bicycle, or by intermediate public transport systems. The main motivation for preparing BRT projects have been to become eligible for the grant aid offered by the central government at the earliest. It is yet to be seen whether public transport, NMV and pedestrian-friendly infrastructure is created when these projects are implemented.<\/p>\n<p>Implementation of BRTs has commenced in Delhi, however, at times it seems that accommodating the demands of the major stakeholders like the \u2018Transport Industry\u2019 in the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC), the public works department, Light Rail Transit and monorail industries in the planning and investment agenda is the primary focus. Providing an efficient and safe transport to the majority, and using public money in the most efficient way is not the driving force for implementing BRTs in Delhi. The company which has been instituted to implement the project, the Delhi Integrated Multimodal Transport System (DIMTS), is also preparing plans for light rail transit and monorail. BRTs road designs have been modified to \u2018improve\u2019 car flow so that after the construction of the BRTs lanes, car users do not suffer, even if it means reducing safety and convenience to pedestrians and bicyclists.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_144\" style=\"width: 658px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-144\" title=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/10\/RV_MG_9983_MUST-USE.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"648\" height=\"432\" \/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">A handcart loaded with goods is pulled by four residents of Gurgaon and typifies an important mode of transport through the business and market districts of Mumbai<\/p><\/div>\n<p>In view of the recently implemented measures and current investment priorities we should expect an increase in the use of private vehicles (both motorised two wheelers and cars) by high- and middle-income households in all Indian cities and use of bicycles and walking by low-income urban residents despite the hostile environment. At present over 20,000 people a year are the victim of fatal traffic crashes and another 400,000 are seriously injured in urban areas. This number is likely to double in the next decade, creating a major public health crisis. With the increase in the use of two wheelers and cars, congestion and environment pollution will continue to deteriorate.<\/p>\n<p>It is clear that the public-transport agenda has failed in Indian cities. With the fascination for capital-intensive rail-based projects, investments in pedestrian, bicycle and road-based public transport infrastructure continues to be neglected. Today public transport users are largely the people who are using these modes not out of choice, but because of financial constraints. With a rise in income the ownership of private vehicles is increasing, people prefer to use private vehicles which can provide them door-to-door connectivity.<\/p>\n<p>The failure of the public transport agenda also reflects the failure of our democratic process because the present mechanism of planning and decision-making does not allow inclusion of the demands of the majority of the city residents who are pedestrians, bicyclists and public transport users. On the one hand, the policy makers are concerned about the growing levels of congestion and pollution. At the same time transport policies continue to encourage the use of private vehicles.<\/p>\n<p>____________________________________________<br \/> Notes<br \/> [1] Registrar General of India, \u2018Census of India 2001\u2019, published by Government of India.<br \/> [2] Traffic and Transport Policies and Strategies in Urban Areas in India\u2019, final report prepared for the Ministry of Urban Affairs and Employment, Government of India, 1998.<br \/> [3] Ministry of Transport and Power, Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi, Delhi, 2006.<br \/> [4] G.

With almost 90 per cent of its population living in officially defined urban areas within its municipal boundaries, Shanghai has the highest level of urbanisation among all large cities in China. With a total fertility rate of only 0.89 in 2010, much lower than the widely accepted replacement level of 2.1, Shanghai has the lowest level of fertility among all large Chinese cities and one of the lowest among world cities. In addition, Shanghai\u2019s proportion of older inhabitants (aged 60 and over) made up 22.5 per cent of the overall population in 2009, a figure that is almost double the national average. The \u2018greying\u2019 of Shanghai, pre-maturely relative to China\u2019s overall development (getting old before getting rich), is associated with and reflected in the city\u2019s changing pattern of diseases, especially those leading causes of death. Since the composition of diseases has a direct bearing on health and well-being in a dense urban environment, understanding the transition of disease pattern in connection to rapid urban restructuring in Shanghai provides valuable insights into what we can expect for other large and dense cities in China and beyond.<\/p>\n<p>To address this topic, I confine the period of study to the last ten years for which comparable data are available and which have witnessed continued rapid urban growth and noticeable shifts in the disease pattern. The data pertains to the cause-specific death rates of the top ten killer diseases and measures of urbanisation, including population density, percentage of non-agriculture population, percentage of service sector output and public urban green space (see Table 1). Using the main findings, I will discuss the effects of urbanisation on population health in general and the pattern of diseases in particular, and highlight policy implications.<\/p>\n<p>During the past decade, Shanghai underwent a dramatic change in its city form and other urban characteristics. With more than 20 million people packed into fixed municipal boundaries, the population density of Shanghai reached 3,030 people per square kilometre in 2009, up by 19.5 per cent from 2000. This indicator rises to 16,000\u201344,000 people per square kilometre in central Shanghai, making the city one of the most crowded megacities in the world. While this level of human density used to be associated with dense industrial activities, especially in the central city, Shanghai has gradually moved away from manufacturing and has been enlarging its service sector. Over the past two decades it has relocated many of its factories to its outlying areas and neighbouring provinces. As a result, manufacturing as a share of Shanghai\u2019s GDP dropped from 60.1 per cent in 1990 to 41.9 per cent in 2000 and then down to 35.9 per cent in 2009, while the service sector\u2019s percentage of GDP rose from 31.9 to 52.1 and then to 59.4 in 2009.<\/p>\n<p>With the transformation of industry structures, the composition of the population changed greatly. The percentage of non-agricultural population increased from 74.6 per cent in 2000 to 88.3 per cent in 2009 (Table 1). Alongside the demographic and economic restructuring, Shanghai\u2019s government focused on increasing green infrastructure, raising the coverage of urban green spaces in the city from 22.2 per cent in 2000 to 38.1 per cent in 2009. These urban changes may have some effect on the health and well-being in Shanghai.<\/p>\n<p>Life expectancy at birth is a general indicator of urban health or health in general. While life expectancy for China doubled from around 35 right after the Communist Revolution of 1949 to about 70 in 1980, the already high life expectancy for Shanghai, relative to the rest of China, rose further through the reform era and again from 73.4 in 1978 to 78.8 in 2000 to then 81.7 in 2009, a figure which was approaching that of Western industrialised countries. Beyond life expectancy, the top ten killer diseases account for more than 90 per cent of the all deaths annually in Shanghai. From 2000 to 2009, the top ten killers were circulation diseases, cancer, respiratory system diseases, damnification and poisoning, endocrine-immunity-metabolic diseases, digestive system diseases, infectious and parasitic diseases, mental system diseases, nervous system diseases and genitourinary diseases. While this pattern was quite stable for the last decade, the top three, namely circulation diseases, cancer and respiratory system diseases caused over three-quarters of all deaths. Cancer-related death per 100,000 rose 16 per cent during the study period, while the death rates of both nervous system diseases and endocrine-immunity-metabolic diseases registered increases of over 60 per cent and became the most significant of increases among the top ten killers in the past decade. Both infectious and parasitic diseases and mental system diseases declined by 30 per cent, respectively. Respiratory system disease rate decreased 16.1 per cent during the past decade. It is clear that chronic diseases have replaced infectious and acute diseases to become major causes of death in Shanghai, which is a much more similar disease pattern to that of Western industrialised countries.<\/p>\n<p>To analyse the direct association between the diseases and measures of urbanisation, specifically density, I have conducted a stepwise regression analysis using limited data and summarise the key findings here (see Table 2). Population density is positively related to the death rates of circulation diseases, cancer and nervous system diseases. While the data did not allow a causal analysis that would include other factors, the evidence suggests that density has something to do with two of the top three killing diseases in Shanghai. To the extent that density reflects the negative effect of a crowded living environment on certain health conditions, the findings point to areas of further research and policy discussion on the mechanisms that transmit the effect of density on critical health outcomes in Shanghai. The analysis also indicates a negative statistical association between the percentage of non-agriculture population and death rates of respiratory system diseases, endocrine-immunity-metabolic diseases and infectious diseases, with the relationship being the strongest for respiratory system diseases. Not being able to control for the potential influence of other factors, it appears that a higher level of industrial activity makes a difference to less people dying from respiratory system diseases. This is consistent with the two parallel trends of more industrialisation and lower death rates from respiratory system diseases in Shanghai over time. The percentage of tertiary industry product of GDP and the percentage of coverage of urban green areas demonstrate mixed effects on some diseases (see Table 2 below).<\/p>\n<p>As Shanghai has been leading all Chinese cities in building skyscrapers, creating wealth and raising the standard of living, the challenge of making the city healthier has risen to the fore and will continue to stay high on the policy agenda. In this essay, I have provided a limited empirical assessment of where Shanghai is in becoming a healthier city in terms of its recent disease profile. One thing is clear, however: Shanghai has become similar to Western cities in terms of the same chronic diseases overtaking acute diseases as the leading causes of death. Since there is some evidence that chronic diseases are related to population density and levels of industrial activity in the expected directions, it calls for more systematic research, using better data, to probe the underlying causal connections. This should facilitate a more informed policy discussion on how to build Shanghai up not only as a wealthy city but also how to turn it into a healthy one as a model for more balanced urban development.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"<p>The author would like to acknowledge the comments and editorial support of Professor Xiangming Chen.<\/p>\n","pdf_uri":"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/11\/2011_chw_5050_Gou.pdf","article_publishing_date":"November 2011","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"127","name":"Youde","created":"2011-11-04 11:38:37","modified":"2011-11-04 11:38:37","slug":null,"family_name":"Gou","title":null,"email_address":null,"photo_legacy":null,"profile_text":null,"organization":null,"role":null,"additional_affiliations":null,"qualifications":null,"staff_pages_blurb":null,"office_location":null,"display_after":null,"display_until":null,"extended_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb_lang2":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation_lang2":null,"phone_number":null}],"attachments":false,"gallery":{"slug":false,"extra_classes":"","slides":[]}},{"request_language":"","current_page_uri":"\/media\/search-dev.json","lang2_slug":false,"lang2_name":false,"parent_publication_id":35,"featured_image_uri":"","article_title":"Urbanising technology","permalink":"urbanising-technology","article_subtitle":"","article_abstract":"","article_summary":"","article_text":"<p>Periods of rapid transition have heuristic potentials. The velocity of change itself makes novel patterns legible. When the object of study is cities, legibility is even more pronounced insofar as the material reality of buildings, transport systems, and other components of spatial organisation are on the surface, so to speak. Simultaneous rapid transformation in several cities with somewhat comparable conditions also makes the variability of such spatial outcomes visible, even when they result from similar novel dynamics. Our global modernity is one of those periods of rapid change. Major advances in building and other technologies have left a massive imprint on urban space.<\/p>\n<p>What stands out is that these technologies have not been sufficiently \u2018urbanised\u2019<a class=\"cite_ref\" id=\"cite_ref-1\" href=\"#cite_note-1\">1<\/a>. On the one hand, cities tend to urbanise technologies \u2013 it is not quite feasible to simply plop down a new technology in urban space. This becomes clear, for example, in the fact that the spatial formats through which density is constituted vary sharply across cities; it means that each city partly reshapes even standard technologies. On the other hand we need to push this urbanising of technology further, and in different directions. For instance, the elusive quality we in the West have come to call urbanity and tend to associate with a high-density centre might well take on different shapes in other cultures. The notion of cityness helps us take some distance from that western notion and allow for a far greater variability in what constitutes urban density and its technologies. This opens up a whole field for research and interpretation, and invites us to reposition western notions of urbanity and to explore a far broader range of articulations of building technologies and urban space.<\/p>\n<p>A first step into this exploration of what it means to urbanise technology is to engage the notion of intelligent systems, a rapidly expanding input for cities. In other words, what does it mean to use intelligent systems without de-urbanizing cities?<\/p>\n<h1>The limits of intelligent systems<\/h1>\n<p>Much of what is put under the \u2018smart city\u2019 umbrella has actually been around for a decade or more. Bit by bit (or byte by byte), we have been retrofitting various city systems and networks with devices that count, measure, record, and connect. The current fashion, however, centres around a costlier, difficult to implement vision. Rather than retrofitting old cities, the buzz today is about building entire smart cities from scratch in a matter of a few years (hence the alternative name \u2018instant city\u2019) at what seems to be an average price of US$30 to US$60 billion (\u20ac23.5 to \u20ac47 billion). Building such a city is a daunting proposition. But I think the biggest challenge is more conceptual: it is the need to design a system that puts all that technology truly at the service of the inhabitants, and not the other way around: the inhabitants as incidental users. <\/p>\n<p>The best known example of an instant smart city is the now famous Songdo International Business District, an intelligent city near Seoul that is equipped with advanced sensors and monitors from Cisco Systems, among others. The city\u2019s multitasking devices are able to open and close, turn on and off, or stop and start everything: from the toaster to the video conference with your boss, or the video camera view of your child at play \u2013 and that is just from the perspective of workers. All of this can be done from both your home and your office, though the distinction between the two becomes increasingly fuzzy in a fully \u2018sensored\u2019 city. Songdo is also about recycling and greening: it is built on reclaimed land and deploys all the latest green technologies.<\/p>\n<p>The other famous example would be Masdar City, in Abu Dhabi. Designed to be carbon free, it is both more scientific, yet, in many ways, less \u2018business intelligent\u2019 than Songdo. It is common to emphasise the commercial side of Masdar as a showcase for products from firms around the world. But I think it is incorrect to simply see it as a commercial showcase. I would describe it as a laboratory, or what social scientists refer to as a natural experiment: a piece of real life that functions as a window, allowing us to learn about an abstract, complex condition (for example, a fully intelligent and green large city), that we cannot replicate in a university laboratory.<\/p>\n<p>Masdar has the same upper and lower worlds that all cities have, but in this instance the lower world includes much more than the usual pipes and tunnels. In Masdar it also includes a hidden trove of advanced technologies for handling all of the basic urban systems: all that flows in and out of the city, whether water or refuse, is measured and monitored and thus produces information. In this sense, everything in Masdar is considered significant. Even refuse is not simply refuse \u2013 it is a source for building knowledge. Meanwhile, the upper part of Masdar, built on a raised platform to give the technology \u2018plumbers\u2019 access to the pipes, is a showcase for an enormous variety of green technology.<\/p>\n<p>All of this brings me to the second reason why I think of Masdar as a laboratory, albeit a lived-in one: few places in the world will be able to replicate Masdar. It is a multi-billion US$ investment for 40,000 residents. While the retrofit innovations of Amsterdam Innovation Motor (AIM) can be replicated throughout the world, in rich and poor cities alike, it is unlikely that anyone will replicate Masdar.<\/p>\n<p>At the other end of the scale is China, which is also building cities \u2013 at least 20 of them are on the drawing board as I write. China will need to house well over 300 million people in the next few years. Its new cities will be planned and intelligent but they will not be little Masdars. They will be giant cities. They will have generous budgets of several hundreds of thousands of US$ to plant and maintain millions of trees, and, with luck, they will have bike lanes and photovoltaics everywhere. That would be a good practical beginning. We need both: a laboratory for the ideal as well as the practical solution.<\/p>\n<h1>What comes next is worrisome<\/h1>\n<p>The first phase of intelligent cities is exciting. The city becomes a living laboratory for smart urban technologies that can handle all the major systems a city requires: water, transport, security, waste, green buildings, and clean energy. The acts of installing, experimenting, testing, or discovering can all generate innovations, both practical and those that exist mainly in the minds of weekend scientists. This is thrilling. And these are projects that will involve foreign and local inventors, scientists, technologists, firms, artists, and curious tourists from around the world. This phase is likely to create a public conversation, not just between the residents and the city\u2019s leadership, but also horizontally, among citizens comparing notes. It could lead to a new type of open-source network:  instead of simply having IT workers detect and fix software and recode to solve problems as they see them, there would be a collective upgrading and problem-solving dimension involving citizens, a sort of open-source urbanism.<\/p>\n<p>But the ensuing phase is what worries me; it is charged with negative potentials. From experimentation, discovery, and open-source urbanism, we could slide into a managed space where \u2018sensored\u2019 becomes \u2018censored\u2019. What stands out is the extent to which these technologies have not been sufficiently \u2018urbanised\u2019. That is, they have not been made to work within a particular urban context. Consider the sharply varying kinds of architecture and building types that have evolved around the world in response to the need for increased density. Masdar looks nothing like Songdo. And compare Dubai and London; both have dense centres but they are built in very different styles. Technology systems that might work in one city might not be desirable in another. But it also tells us that a city can urbanize that technology and wire its capacities into an older concept of the urban or into a whole new visual order. <\/p>\n<h1>The push to urbanise technology<\/h1>\n<p>We need to push this urbanising of technology further, and in different directions.<\/p>\n<p>Wherever I go in the world, I find at least some technologists, urbanists, and artists who are beginning to \u2018urbanise\u2019 technology. Cloud9, a Barcelona-based project that mixes science, technology, and architecture is a good example, one that draws and needs all types of people \u2013 children, professionals, and tourists alike. When this happens, the city becomes a heuristic space; it talks with the average resident or visitor rather than simply commanding them. The technology becomes visible and explicit and can be understood by any passer-by. I have long thought that all the major infrastructures in a city \u2013 from sewage to electricity and broadband \u2013 should be encased in transparent walls and floors at certain crossroads, such as bus stops or public squares. If you can actually see it all, you can get engaged. Today, when walls are pregnant with soft- and hardware, why not make this visible? All of our computerised systems should become transparent. The city would become literally a publicly shared domain.<\/p>\n<p>The challenge for intelligent cities is to make the technologies they deploy responsive and intellectually\/practically available to the people whose lives they affect. Today, the tendency is to make them invisible, hiding them beneath platforms or behind walls \u2013 hence putting them in command rather than in dialogue with users. This secluding of technologies reduces the possibility that intelligent cities can promote open-source urbanism.<\/p>\n<h1>Open source urbanism?<\/h1>\n<p>Taking the urbanising of technology to the next stage would increase and diversify the articulations between technology and urban space. It would unsettle current internal boundaries in cities and cut across the traditional domains \u00ad\u2013 the economy, the polity, the social, culture. Technology and the environment can come together in many more ways than they do today in most cities. <\/p>\n<p>\u2018Urbanised\u2019 technology can make the city a heuristic space. It could tell the average resident or passer-by something about the most advanced types of applied technologies used in cities and about the variability of spatial forms through which these uses of technology work and become legible to the passer-by. This variability of spatial formats can become a powerful representation of the many ways in which technologies can be urbanised. It can show how multiple applied technologies within a city also make the diverse interactions that can take place in urban space visible, thus having the double effect of being both operational and inform the passer-by on what it means to urbanise technology. This brings to the fore the differing degrees of openness of cities. I prefer to think of this as the incompleteness of cities, which means that they can constantly be remade, for better or for worse. It is this incompleteness that has allowed some of the world\u2019s great old cities to outlast kingdoms, empires, nation-states and powerful enterprises. <\/p>\n<p>Let me take the imagery of incompleteness further. Powerful actors can remake cities in their image. But cities talk back<a class=\"cite_ref\" id=\"cite_ref-2\" href=\"#cite_note-2\">2<\/a>. Sometimes it may take decades, and sometimes it is immediate. We can think of the multiple ways in which the city talks back as a type of open-source urbanism: the city as partly made through a myriad of interventions and little changes from the ground up. Each of these multiple small interventions may not look like much, but together they give added meaning to the notion of the incompleteness of cities, the city as somewhat of a mutant.  <\/p>\n<p>In sharp contrast, I think there is a futile search to eliminate incompleteness in the model of \u2018intelligent cities\u2019 as propounded by and through the purveyors of increasingly massive intelligent systems. The planners of intelligent cities make these technologies invisible, and hence put them in command rather than in dialogue with users. One effect is that intelligent cities become closed systems, and that is a pity. It will cut their lives short. They will become obsolete sooner. And, as these complex technical systems become obsolete, they may drag down with them the buildings within which they are housed. This becomes particularly acute given the accelerated rate of technological obsolescence. <\/p>\n<p>Beyond the imagery of open-source urbanisms, can we strengthen the positive scenario of the city&#8217;s incompleteness by actually deploying open-source technologies in a variety of urban contexts? Can we urbanise open-source technology itself, and might the complexity of urban settings help us do so?  <\/p>\n<p>As a technological practice of innovation, open source has not quite been about cities, but about the technology. Yet it resonates with what cities have and are at ground level, where its users are. The park is made not only with the hardware of trees and ponds, but also with the software of people\u2019s practices. A good example here is the turnaround of New York&#8217;s Riverside Park from being a no-go zone in the 1970s to being a park for all those who wanted to use it, in part because dog owners started to walk their dogs in large numbers. Having a dog was itself an effect of feeling insecure in a city of high murder rates and much mugging. But the city allowed people to talk back: get a dog, walk your dog, usually a routine of mornings and evenings which produced a group effect, and you recover the territory of the park. This shows us how the mix of urban space and people\u2019s daily practices generated a public good \u2013no matter how selfish the dog walkers might have been. I see here an urban capability at work<a class=\"cite_ref\" id=\"cite_ref-3\" href=\"#cite_note-3\">3<\/a>. The proliferation of farmers\u2019 markets was also not a top-down decision. It resulted from a mix of conditions, primarily the desire of city residents to have access to fresh produce. A thousand individual decisions created a possibility for viable farmers markets. <\/p>\n<p>Could urbanising open source technology and its cognates generate such capabilities? Sorts of events whereby hundreds of individuals react to a condition in a similar way to produce perceptible civic outcomes: buying dogs\/recovering the park, or wanting fresh produce\/creating farmers\u2019 markets? And how can this open sourcing be used to better predict and avoid negative outcomes? How can we urbanise the actual technology? <\/p>\n<p>In many ways, cities tend to urbanise technologies semi-autonomously, since it is still not quite feasible to simply plop down a new technology in urban space. It requires modifications, mediations. Major advances in building and other technologies have left a massive imprint on urban space. This is perhaps most visible in the sharp increases in density and networked systems that the new technologies have made possible. But a closer look suggests that these modifications have to do with overcoming rigidities and risks, especially risks catalogued by insurance companies. This mode is then only vaguely one of urbanising the technology. <\/p>\n<p>Since open source is different from those technologies and technological applications, I am interested in understanding how it can take us to the next step. I see in open source a DNA that resonates strongly with how people make the city theirs, or urbanise what might be an individual initiative. And yet, as a technology it has mostly not engaged the city. I think that it will require <em>making<\/em>. We need to push this urbanising of open source technology to strengthen horizontal practices and initiatives. Leading urban civic institutions matter in this effort, but they tend to verticalise the work of making the urban. I think of this project as a sort of \u2018Urban Wikileaks\u2019. By this I mean, for instance, vertical institutions that begin to leak some of their power and bureaucratic control to a more generic operational space that enables citizens to work with at least some of what is useful in those leaks. This is akin to horizontalising what is now vertical, imposed by top-down authority and expertise. Developing an Urban Wikileaks would take cities in a very different direction from the intelligent city model \u2013 and for the better.<\/p>\n<p>There is much work to be done. Recovering the incompleteness of cities means recovering a space where the work of open-sourcing <em>the urban<\/em> can thrive.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"<p>This piece is based on a two-year research project with the same title supported with an AUDI research grant.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"cite_note\" id=\"cite_note-1\" href=\"#cite_ref-1\">1<\/a> \u201cUrban Stories, or\u2026Towards a Hermeneutics of Big Data\u201d Presented at the Urban Code: Big Data Conference, SENSELab, MIT, November 15, 2012.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"cite_note\" id=\"cite_note-2\" href=\"#cite_ref-2\">2<\/a> This is further developed in \u201cDoes the City Have Speech?\u201d, Public Culture, forthcoming.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"cite_note\" id=\"cite_note-3\" href=\"#cite_ref-3\">3<\/a> \u201cUrban Capabilities.\u201d Journal of International Affairs, Spring\/Summer 2012, Vol. 65, No. 2, pp.85-95<\/p>\n","pdf_uri":"","article_publishing_date":"December 2012","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"2","name":"Saskia","created":"2011-08-24 17:21:14","modified":"2014-05-02 16:17:31","slug":"sassen-saskia","family_name":"Sassen","title":"","email_address":"","photo_legacy":"\/0_images\/02-SSassen.jpg","profile_text":"Saskia Sassen is the Robert S.

The 2012 US Presidential campaign provided only the latest example of the deep chasm that separates our political parties. On the one hand, Republican Presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who supported a state green energy fund as Governor of Massachusetts, criticised the Obama Administration for an \u2018unhealthy obsession with green jobs\u2019, while President Obama defended his administration\u2019s investments in renewable energy projects over the past four years and argued that Governor Romney policies show a \u2018disdain for green energy\u2019.<br \/>\nThis partisan debate at the national level occurs at a time in which US federal government support for the clean energy and energy-efficiency sectors are likely to decline, even though President Obama has just been re-elected for another term. In the past several years, through subsidies, loan guarantees, and tax expenditures, the US government became a major supporter of the nascent clean economy, committing more than US$150 billion to clean energy projects between 2009 and 2014. Over the next few years, however, it is likely that federal support will be radically reduced as numerous programmes and policies are set to expire, from production tax credits for wind energy to investment tax credits for solar energy. In total, 63 of the 92 federal clean energy finance policies that were in place in 2009 will have expired by 2014. Given the difficult budget challenges the US government faces as it attempts to control the skyrocketing federal deficit, it is likely that many of these programmes will be scaled back if not eliminated altogether.<br \/>\nThe irony, of course, is that in the midst of uncertainty and division at the federal level there is a large, diverse, and growing clean economy emerging in the US, concentrated primarily in America\u2019s largest cities and metropolitan areas. Over the past two years, Brookings research has identified nearly 2.7 million clean jobs, making the clean economy nearly 60 per cent of the size of the America\u2019s IT sector (4.8 million jobs), and larger than its fossil fuel industry (2.4 million jobs). These jobs span five major categories \u2013 renewable energy; energy and resource efficiency; greenhouse gas reduction, environmental management, and recycling; agricultural and natural resources conservation; education and compliance \u2013 and naturally break down into 39 fine-grained segments. Renewable energy, for instance, has 9 segments, including solar and geothermal power and renewable energy services, while energy and resource efficiency has 13 separate segments, from electric vehicle technology to water efficient products.<br \/>\nBeyond these large groups, Brookings also identified a group of young, innovative \u2018cleantech\u2019 industries that cross multiple categories and show enormous growth potential. This portfolio of segments, including wind power, battery technologies, biofuels, and smart-grid technology, grew about 8 per cent a year between 2003 and 2010, twice as fast as the rest of the US economy.<br \/>\nThe clean economy is not just broad and diverse; it is disproportionately productive and export-oriented. In 2009, US clean economy establishments exported almost US$54 billion, including about US$49.5 billion in goods and an additional US$4.5 billion in services, making the clean economy twice as export-intensive as the national economy. Over US$20,000 worth of exports is sold for every job in the clean economy each year compared to just US $10,400 worth of exports for the average US job. The export orientation of the clean economy today provides a platform for more exports tomorrow. With rising nations rapidly urbanising, the demand for sustainable growth in all its dimensions will only grow, and the US has the potential to serve that demand.<br \/>\nThe American clean economy also supports a production-driven innovation economy. In fact, 10 per cent of clean economy jobs are in science and engineering fields, compared to 5 per cent in the US overall, and 26 per cent of all clean economy jobs are involved in manufacturing, compared to just 9 per cent of jobs in the US economy as a whole. Manufacturing accounts for a majority of the jobs in over half of the clean economy segments, with many sectors having a super-majority of production-oriented jobs. Solar and wind energy, for example, have more than two thirds of their jobs in manufacturing. And some segments, including appliances, water-efficient products, and electric vehicle technologies have over 90 per cent of their jobs in manufacturing. Clean manufacturing is a growing sector, part of an overall resurgence of manufacturing in the US over the last few years.<br \/>\nFinally, the clean economy is opportunity rich, providing prospects for a wide range of American workers, and good wages up and down the skills ladder. Forty-five per cent of all clean jobs are held by workers with a high-school diploma or less, compared to only 37 per cent of US jobs. Once a worker enters the field, they are more likely to receive career-building training, as 41 per cent of clean jobs offer medium to long-term training, compared to 23 per cent of US jobs on average. The pay-off is higher wages, as the median wage in the clean economy is almost US $44,000 for the average occupation, significantly higher than the national equivalent of slightly over US$38,000.<br \/>\nAmerica\u2019s 100 largest metropolitan areas, which take up only 12 per cent of its land mass but harbour two-thirds of the population and generate 75 per cent of the country\u2019s GDP, are driving growth in the clean economy. In 2010, the top 100 metropolitan areas in the US constituted almost 64 per cent of clean economy jobs overall, and an outsized share \u2013 74 per cent \u2013 of jobs in cleantech industries, including extraordinarily high shares of jobs in solar photovoltaic, battery technologies, smart grid, and wind energy. Innovative clean jobs are predominantly located in the top 100 metropolitan areas because these places concentrate the assets that drive innovation, from initial research to commercialisation and, ultimately, to deployment.<br \/>\nMetro economies, of course, do not exist in the aggregate. Each metropolitan area has a distinctive starting point and distinctive assets, attributes, and advantages. Brookings research has profiled the clean economy potential of each of the top 100 metropolitan areas. Four of these \u2013 New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Washington \u2013 are supersized job centres, with more than 70,000 jobs each in the clean economy in 2010. The New York metropolitan area alone has more than 152,000 clean economy jobs, while other major metropolitan areas, such as Philadelphia, San Francisco, Atlanta, Boston, Houston, and Dallas, are also large clean job centres, with more than 38,000 jobs each in 2010.<br \/>\nYet this is not just about the largest metropolitan areas. A number of small and medium-sized metropolitan areas, including Knoxville, Tennessee, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and Toledo, Ohio, have more than 3.3 per cent of their jobs situated in the clean economy, while Albany, New York, leads the way with clean jobs accounting for an impressive 6.3 per cent of its total employment.<br \/>\nThe power of cities and metropolitan areas is the power of agglomeration, networks, and clusters. Brookings research found that clusters \u2013 the proximity of firms to businesses in related industries \u2013 boost metropolitan areas\u2019 growth performance in the clean economy, and also that metropolitan areas facilitate clustering. There are numerous examples of clean clusters throughout the US, including professional environmental services in Houston, solar photovoltaic in Los Angeles, fuel cells in Boston, wind in Chicago, water industries in Milwaukee, and energy efficiency in Philadelphia.<br \/>\nAs America continues to struggle with the challenge of high levels of joblessness \u2013 11.1 million jobs are needed by the most recent estimates \u2013 and an overall sluggish economic recovery, how does one unlock this engine of growth in its cities and metropolitan areas?<br \/>\nA strong policy platform is critical for the clean economy to realise its full potential. In an ideal world, an economy shaping of this magnitude should start at the national scale, with the federal government implementing policies to scale up markets to catalyse demand for clean economy goods and services, drive innovation by investing in advanced R&#038;D at scale and over a sustained period of time, catalyse finance to produce and deploy more of what the US invents, and align its policies with cities and metropolitan areas to realise the synergies of clustering and place.<br \/>\nBut, as mentioned before, political polarisation and fiscal retrenchment at the federal level will likely prevent this from happening. Fortunately, the US has a default proposition when the national government falters \u2013 US states act as \u2018laboratories of democracy\u2019, and cities and metropolitan areas act as the laboratories of innovation.<\/p>\n<p>America\u2019s states, cities, and metropolitan areas are awash with leadership. This \u2018Pragmatic Caucus\u2019 of political, business, civic, university, and environmental leaders prize place over party, collaboration over conflict, and evidence over ideology. And this Caucus is building the clean economy the hard way \u2013 from the ground up, despite political odds and fiscal obstacles. <\/p>\n<p>There is no shortage of policy innovation and political commitment to highlight in America\u2019s states and metropolitan areas.  <\/p>\n<p>To scale up markets, California has set an aggressive renewable portfolio standard (RPS) that mandates 33 per cent come from renewable sources by 2020. With this strong foundation, San Jose and other cities and counties in California are doing their part to facilitate consumer adoption by streamlining or even eliminating building permitting for solar panels. <\/p>\n<p>To drive innovation, Wisconsin has created the School of Freshwater Sciences at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee to leverage that metro\u2019s rising position in the \u201cblue economy.\u201d The Milwaukee Water Council is building on this, spearheading a network of scientists and companies to realize Milwaukee\u2019s ambition to be a global hub for freshwater research, firm creation and business expansion.  <\/p>\n<p>To catalyse finance, Connecticut recently created the Connecticut Clean Energy Finance and Investment Authority.  This Green Bank, capitalised with some US $50 million annually, could accelerate the generation, transmission and adoption of alternative energy in the state. At the municipal level, Connecticut\u2019s neighbour New York City has capitalized an Energy Efficiency Corporation to spur the financing of energy efficiency in the building sector. <\/p>\n<p>And, finally, smart metros are now moving to build out their distinctive industry clusters.  In Greater Seattle, for example, the Puget Sound Regional Council has developed a business plan to cement that metro\u2019s natural position as a global hub of energy efficient building technologies.  The smart public-private initiative to date is the establishment of a facility to test, integrate and verify promising energy efficient products and services before launching them to market. Significantly, this metro vision is being supported by the State of Washington, which has committed to match any federal investment in the testing network.<\/p>\n<p>These examples from states and metropolitan areas demonstrate that the United States \u2013 and the world \u2013 is in the early stages of a clean economy revolution. This revolution will be determined, shaped, and delivered by cities and metropolitan areas, both in mature economies and rising nations alike. As in any industrial revolution, benefits will accrue disproportionately to those firms and communities that are the first movers, the first inventors, the first adaptors, and the first producers. To update an old maxim, \u201cto the innovative belong the economic spoils: jobs, investment, and a higher quality of life.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Will the US step up to the challenge? Over the next four years, President Obama will let us know.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":"","article_publishing_date":"December 2012","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"191","name":"Bruce","created":"2012-03-12 10:49:00","modified":"2012-11-30 19:22:20","slug":"katz-bruce","family_name":"Katz","title":"","email_address":"","photo_legacy":"","profile_text":"<p>Bruce Katz is a Vice President at the Brookings Institution and founding Director of the Brookings Metropolitan Policy Program.<\/p>","organization":"","role":"","additional_affiliations":"","qualifications":"","staff_pages_blurb":"","office_location":"","display_after":"","display_until":"","extended_blurb":"","special_2012ec_blurb":"<p>Bruce J.

Since 2005 we have explored regions of the world that are rapidly urbanising and where cities are experiencing significant, and sometimes traumatic, growth. With more than half of the world\u2019s population already living in cities, this year we ask ourselves the question: how do cities affect the health and well-being of more than three billion urban dwellers? From Mexico City, S\u00e3o Paulo and New York in the Americas, to Johannesburg in Africa, Shanghai and Mumbai in Asia, London and Berlin in Europe \u2013 and Istanbul straddling the two continents \u2013 the Urban Age has studied metropolitan areas with a collective population of more than 120 million people. Now we turn our attention to the unique conditions of the city-state of Hong Kong, adding a further seven million residents at the gateway of the People\u2019s Republic of China, a country that, along with India, is spearheading the epochal shift from rural to urban habitation.<\/p>\n<p>The cities studied so far present an uneven social and spatial landscape, illustrated by our research published in <em>Living in the Endless City<\/em> (Phaidon, 2011). Hong Kong adds a new dimension to these global statistics. Peak population densities achieved in New York and Shanghai are dwarfed by Hong Kong, leaving London and Mexico City well behind. Its compact urban form and highly efficient public transport system makes Hong Kong one of the greenest cities of the Urban Age sample. Only 6 per cent of the population use private cars and nearly 90 per cent take boats, trams and trains or walk, surpassing New York and London, where 58 per cent and 63 per cent respectively use public transport. While income inequality is as high as in Mexico City or New York, murder rates are the lowest of all Urban\u00a0Age cities.<\/p>\n<p>By looking at Hong Kong through the lens of urban health and well-being, we discovered its citizens can also expect to live longer than most in the world \u2013 82.5 years compared to 51 in Johannesburg or 72 in Istanbul. We learnt that, despite high health outcomes, pollution can reach dangerous levels and that the pressure on space and high real estate prices, especially in central areas, affect all aspects of urban life: from how many children people choose to have, to how often they can play their favourite sports and how they socialise with friends and family. Like other world cities, Hong Kong displays distinctive patterns of social and spatial inequalities that are reflected in the quality of life of its citizens.<\/p>\n<p>For these reasons, we chose to use Hong Kong as a platform for research and debate on the complex links between cities, health and well-being. Not because it is more problematic than others, but because it concentrates the conflicts and opportunities of living in a dense urban environment. The initial results of this enquiry are set out in the essay that follows, informed by reflections by international scholars and practitioners whose insights can be accessed online.<\/p>\n<p>The rest of this conference newspaper is then divided into two parts. The first offers a global comparison between cities, while the second focuses on Hong Kong. Global patterns of urbanisation and health are followed by comparative data on growth, density, age distribution, workforce and transport in nine Urban Age cities, including Hong Kong. The spatial, social and health DNA of Hong Kong is then explored in greater depth, through a series of essays, data analysis and new qualitative research on high-density neighbourhoods carried out by LSE Cities and the University of Hong Kong.<\/p>\n<p>Since the establishment of LSE Cities in 2010 \u2013 an international centre based at the London School of Economics and Political Science supported by Deutsche Bank \u2013 we have worked on specific annual themes that form an interdisciplinary enquiry into cities, based on linking the physical and social worlds that we construct around ourselves.<\/p>\n<p>Last year we worked closely with the US-based Brookings Institution to understand how cities can respond to economic challenges and jointly developed a Global MetroMonitor of economic performance of more than 150 metropolitan regions across the world (globalmetrosummit.net\/gmm\/). This year we have extended this approach to understanding urban health, developing a new index of health for 129 metropolitan regions, as part of a research project that will be expanded with new partners and cities. In 2012, under the banner of the \u2018electric city\u2019, we will focus on how metropolitan centres can be designed, managed and governed to be more smart, exploring the economic potential of green cities and their impact on society and the environment, holding the Urban Age conference in London during the Olympic year.<\/p>\n<p>By bringing together urban experts in planning, health, design and governance from four different continents, it is our hope that the Hong Kong Urban Age conference will contribute to our understanding of the links between cities, health and well-being, kick-starting new lines of research, enquiry and practice that will help make cities more liveable in a world where at least 70 per cent of us will be urban by 2050.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/11\/2011_chw_1010_Burdett-Nowak.pdf","article_publishing_date":"November 2011","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"53","name":"Ricky","created":"2011-10-11 21:01:44","modified":"2014-02-04 12:29:29","slug":"burdett-ricky","family_name":"Burdett","title":"","email_address":"r.burdett@lse.ac.uk","photo_legacy":"","profile_text":"Ricky Burdett is Professor of Urban Studies and Director of LSE Cities.","organization":"LSE Cities, London School of Economics and Political Science","role":"Director","additional_affiliations":"Professor of Urban Studies, London School of Economics and Political Science Global Distinguished Professor, New York University","qualifications":"","staff_pages_blurb":"Ricky Burdett is Professor of Urban Studies, and director of LSE Cities and the Urban Age Programme.

My own view can be stated simply: the quality of life in a city is good when its inhabitants are capable of dealing with complexity. Conversely, the quality of life in cities is bad when its inhabitants are capable only of dealing with people like themselves. Put another way, a healthy city can embrace and make productive use of the differences of class, ethnicity, and lifestyles it contains, while a sick city cannot; the sick city isolates and segregates difference, drawing no collective strength from its mixture of different people.<\/p>\n<p>This simple concept of urban \u2018quality of life\u2019 has informed my writings and my design practice through my entire career; it first came to me as a young man attending a conference somewhat like this one, held in Washington in the late 1960s, discussing mental health issues among poor urban residents. The conference focused on alienated, often violent, adolescents, at a time when many of these young people were rioting. Perhaps because most of the professionals at that conference were psychiatrists, they focused on individual psychology. The objection I had was not just that impersonal conditions shape personal sentiments, but more that the city shapes personality in a particular way. The process of human maturation, particularly the passage into adulthood, requires that human beings learn how to deal with situations beyond their personal control, and with persons who are strangers to them, strangers who are ineradicably different, and difficult to understand. America\u2019s racially segregated ghettoes offered no such opportunity to learn this, nor do isolated ghettoes today, anywhere in the world.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve sought to elaborate this insight more largely. All adults in cities need to develop certain skills of living with strangers. My own career has sought to define just what are these \u2018stranger skills\u2019 and how cities can be designed to promote this human competence\u2014my pre-occupation from the book The Uses of Disorder, which I wrote just after attending the conference, to the book on cooperation, Together, which is just about to be published.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll sense from this biographical note why my work diverges from what economists now call \u2018happiness studies.\u2019 Learning to interact well with strangers requires a toleration of ambiguity, the capacity to contain frustration, an ability to listen carefully to people whose speech, needs, or desires may seem alien; none of these skills falls within the domain of pleasure, if that\u2019s what happiness is; indeed, the entry into adulthood occurs exactly when people become capable of feeling connected to, and even solidarity with, other people who give them no pleasure. For these reasons, instead of happiness we should stress the concept of \u2018social competence\u2019 as the measure of an adult\u2019s quality of life.<\/p>\n<p>Because cities are complex social as well as economic and geographic organisms, they are in principle a fertile soil for developing social competence. But we know in fact that they are not. If you were to be transported back to London in 1812, you would find most of the city mixed locally and loosely, the rich and poor, new migrant with old resident, commerce and housing; by 1900, London was becoming more internally homogeneous, but still with lots of loose edges where differences intersect; today\u2019s London has sealed these edges, as in the walls of highway traffic segregating unlike communities, or shopping districts where no one lives, or offices centres isolated from the rest of the city. This history is the story repeated in today\u2019s cities outside Europe; as they grow to giant size, they become relentlessly more homogeneous and segregated internally. One consequence is a diminished quality of life, in the developmental terms I\u2019ve defined: any city of isolated human islands aborts the experience of difference, rendering people less socially competent.<\/p>\n<p>This threat has both political and economic dimensions. People who are ignorant of lives unlike their own are going to have trouble practicing democracy, as the philosopher Hannah Arendt observed in The Human Condition; they will have trouble understanding and dealing with interests and needs not their own. Social incompetence also has an economic dimension. In self-contained economic islands in cities, the process of communicating bad news and unforeseen threats shuts down, as has occurred on Wall Street and the financial City of London; people are not looking outside themselves. The outward-looking orientation bred by social competence, by contrast, has great practical value: it enables collective realism.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019d like close these remarks about the quality of life in cities by focusing on the Holy Grail for urban designers like myself, the quest to build truly mixed-use environments in order that the inhabitants develop a more complex, adult understanding of one another. Much of this work has focused on housing, mixing poor and middle-class residents; this kind of design runs counter socially to the gated housing community. We\u2019ve learned some design techniques for achieving this goal, in the arrangement of stairwells, windows, and interior spaces so that the poor are not visually stigmatised; and the architecture itself has proved successful in New York\u2019s Stuyvesant Town, in new social housing in the London Borough of Hackney, and in one of Johannesberg\u2019s new developments in Soweto. But these mixed settlements are all fragile; in time, the middle-classes tend to evict the poor.<\/p>\n<p>In the re-planning of Beirut after its civil war, I puzzled how to avoid such eviction, and came to the conclusion that the principle of mixed use is usually not pushed far enough: there has to be a tighter integration of working space and living space, as in interleaving offices and specialised factories as well as shops with housing. The key to this kind of planning is informality: leaving the mixed spaces loose in form, open to a succession of small entrepreneurs and businesses. Paradoxically, open, thorough-going mixed-use of this sort tends to stabilize communities, or at least we found it so in Beirut, or, in an entirely different context, on the outskirts of Oslo; such thoroughly-mixed communities have proved sustainable economically for both the poor and the middle-class. This Holy Grail of planning \u2013 seemingly so special \u2013 has in fact been an unplanned historical reality for many cities, especially port cities and trading cities from Venice to Bombay.<\/p>\n<p>I invoke this model only as it bears on the issue of \u2018quality of life\u2019 we have been pondering. In thoroughly-mixed communities people have to engage constantly with fluid differences of all sorts \u2013 different kinds of activities and different kinds of people. Difference is a source of stimulation. This stimulation may not make citizens happier but it does make them more alert. My argument to you is that alertness and attentiveness to the unfamiliar, the strange, and the uncertain is an adult strength, a form of human development which urban designers and planners like ourselves can foster by taking down the internal, isolating walls of the city.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/11\/2011_chw_4025_Sennett.pdf","article_publishing_date":"November 2011","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"23","name":"Richard","created":"2011-10-04 13:06:04","modified":"2014-04-08 17:47:21","slug":"sennett-richard","family_name":"Sennett","title":"","email_address":"","photo_legacy":"","profile_text":"Richard Sennett is Professor of Sociology, LSE and University Professor of the Humanities, New York University.","organization":"LSE Cities, London School of Economics and Political Science","role":"Chair of the Advisory Board","additional_affiliations":"Professor of Sociology, London School of Economics and Political Sciences\nUniversity Professor of the Humanities, New York University","qualifications":"","staff_pages_blurb":"Richard Sennett is a sociologist and Professor of Sociology at the London School of Economics and Political Sciences, and University Professor of the Humanities at New York University.

In this context, Rio de Janeiro developed with informal settlements scattered among middle- and upper-class neighbourhoods. The rich didn\u2019t want to live on hilltops without electricity, water or rubbish and sewage collection, but they didn\u2019t mind if their servants resided conveniently close by.<\/p>\n<p>Such geography led to a symbiosis that produced rich interconnecting webs of personal relations, Carnival, samba, funk, beach culture, art, and much else worth celebrating. At the same time, those webs, unchecked by government or the press, together with a phase of liberalisation following the departure of the 1964\u201385 military government, allowed criminal gangs to take over and run informal territories, or <em>favelas<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>As kidnappings and other crimes spread, and the economy foundered, in the 1980s Rio lost banks, the stock market and much else, to S\u00e3o Paulo. Factories closed. The city\u2019s downtown and its contiguous port went into decay and lost its residential population.<\/p>\n<p>Due to the ensuing safety issues as well as the daunting complexity of urban renewal, residents, commerce, investment and real estate developers turned westwards to rural and empty beachfront areas within the city limits.<\/p>\n<p>This exodus was particularly devastating for the industrial and working-class North Zone, close to the port and the international airport (which then became assets for those who went into the drugs and weapons businesses). But even the glitzy South Zone \u2013 Copacabana, Ipanema, and Leblon \u2013 suffered private- and public-sector neglect and depreciation, with residents dodging bullets flying off drug-dealers\u2019 hilltops.<\/p>\n<p>And, although there are few hilltops in the expanding lagoon-dotted West Zone, a similar pattern emerged there: construction workers and other unskilled labourers were relegated to the edges of mangrove swamps, while their employers swarmed to beachfront property, gated communities and shopping malls. Ultimately, the city had allowed developers to build what amounted to a Brazilian Miami \u2013 without a sewerage system or effective public transportation. Traffic jams, <em>favelas<\/em> and clogged lagoons ensued, with the city\u2019s poorest section in its furthest reaches.<\/p>\n<p>The 1990s and 2000s saw the rich building ever-higher walls in the entire city, hiring ever-bigger armies of security personnel, and keeping close to home and work. The city withered. In the latter decade, the Rio\u2019s state-run police force, largely corrupt (partnering with the drug and weapons trade), kept an uneasy peace by way of periodic incursions into North and South Zone <em>favelas<\/em>. In the West Zone, off-duty and retired police and firemen organised <em>mil\u00edcias<\/em>. Welcomed at first, these groups evolved into violent extortionist gangs with their own wheeling and dealing in the areas of transport, bottled cooking gas and infrastructure \u2013 and got themselves duly represented on the city council and in the state legislature.<\/p>\n<p>With the election of S\u00e9rgio Cabral as governor in 2006, the Rio police took a new approach to public safety, which gained continuity with his 2010 re-election. Dubbed pacification, the largely successful policy focuses on retaking territory from drug traffickers, mostly in the North and South Zones. Reducing daily gun violence directly, so far, for about 500,000 <em>favela<\/em> residents, the policy has halved Rio\u2019s homicide rate (to 24 per 100,000 a year, although numbers seem to fluctuate slightly between sources), raised real estate values, drawn investment and allowed citizens greater mobility.<sup>1<\/sup><\/p>\n<p>Thus began an urban turnaround that now faces huge challenges. Rio has become in effect two cities. The sprawling West Zone, riddled with <em>mil\u00edcias<\/em> and new construction, will host most of the 2016 Olympic Games. The degraded, more densely populated North and South Zones, safer than in decades past, are starting to integrate both formal and informally settled areas into a single vibrant fabric.<\/p>\n<p>Then there is the Centre, where tunnels and open areas will replace an elevated motorway, augmenting access to the Bay. Light rail transportation will connect new office buildings in the renovated port area to the traditional centre. A cable-car system will take residents and tourists up and down to Rio\u2019s oldest <em>favela<\/em>, Morro da Provid\u00eancia. What the expanded downtown will look and feel like in five or ten years is an open question.<\/p>\n<p>It should be noted that all of this takes place in a context of nearly full employment, the result of local petroleum and gas investment, a series of mega-events, federal funding for local initiatives, significant national economic growth (starting to ebb now), and the widening of Brazil\u2019s socio-economic pyramid, with thousands of Rio\u2019s 1.4 million <em>favela<\/em> residents joining the formal economy and the lower ranks of the middle classes.<\/p>\n<p>The challenge is basically to transform a two-tier system (public, for the poor, and private, for the better-off) of transport, education, public safety, housing and health into something more democratic. Added to this are the inefficiencies of a state-run public sanitation company that provides water to just about everyone, but collects and adequately treats the sewage of only 30 per cent of the city.<\/p>\n<p>The transformation requires changing the priorities, the mindset and the standing of a host of entrenched interests, political and economic. These interests have long called the shots in Rio. Elected representatives rubber-stamped the mayor and governor\u2019s wishes, with little initiative or accountability to voters, perpetuating and strengthening the power of urban players, including the <em>mil\u00edcias<\/em>, bus and construction companies, and real estate developers.<\/p>\n<p>The elected city council is apparently so useless that Mayor Eduardo Paes, a modern-minded, yet authoritarian young politician voted into a second term last year, appointed a new City Council of 136 members to advise him on two strategic plans. Notably, none of its illustrious, mostly white, mostly male, members live in a <em>favela<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, citizens have traditionally shunned what they consider to be \u2018dirty politics\u2019, with the upper classes simply pulling strings when they need to. Local media, virtually monopolised by the Globo empire, have only this year begun to report on how Rio truly functions.<\/p>\n<p>To further close the inequality gap, preserve diversity and hasten lasting social change \u2013 in other words, to realise its enormous cultural and economic potential \u2013 the city of Rio proper (population 6.3 million) must now provide full-blown city and state services to both formal and informal areas, address transportation issues stemming from urban sprawl, and bring together North, South and West Zones into a workable territory that, at 1,182km<sup>2<\/sup>, is an enormous challenge even without the neighbouring towns that double the population to a metropolitan area of twelve million souls. In comparison, New York City, covering 1,213km<sup>2<\/sup> and London, at 1,572km<sup>2<\/sup>, are each home to just over eight million. But these megalopolises are set in more highly developed democracies, with many more checks and balances on urban development.<\/p>\n<p>Governor Cabral and Mayor Paes, supported by ample federal funding, have achieved much. Yet the progress seems diminished by the long roster of what remains to be done:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Coordinate with neighbouring cities around metropolitan issues such as harbour clean-up, inter-municipal transport, employment and long-term public safety policies. Greater Rio accounts for three quarters of the state\u2019s total population of 16 million.<\/li>\n<li>Demilitarise and unify Rio\u2019s several police forces, with better training and efficiency, to reduce abuse and improve pacification efforts. Although public safety officials have arrested growing numbers of drug traffickers, they must also address criminals\u2019 flight within the metropolitan area.<\/li>\n<li>Focus on housing, particularly low-income, and particularly close to jobs. Housing policy centres on the federal low-income Minha Casa Minha Vida (MCMV, My House My Life) programme, plagued by corruption, bureaucracy, shoddy construction, and a lack of community participation and vision as to where and how low-income families should live in dignity. The MCMV programme contracted the build of 90,211 homes in the state of Rio de Janeiro, and by last July had only delivered 16,216 units. Other efforts have produced even smaller results.<\/li>\n<li>Further improve public health and education, while increasing coordination between state and municipal levels.<\/li>\n<li>Make good on a widely heralded programme, Morar Carioca, to upgrade all favelas by 2020, now scaled back to provide infrastructure only \u2013 due to lack of government funds and market incentives.<\/li>\n<li>Further improve public transport. This has focused on connecting the West Zone to the rest of the city, with dedicated bus lanes and an extension to a line of the state metro concession. Experts call for upgrades of existing North Zone train lines, to keep residents closer to the centre and add value to a region in decline. The city has noticeably reorganised and improved bus service but this still falls far short of passenger demands, at the centre of constant pressure on the city council.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The constant pressure on the elected city council demand has arisen from street demonstrations that erupted last June, settling in downtown Rio and outside the governor\u2019s South Zone offices and apartment building.<\/p>\n<p>Before June 2013, it looked as though Rio\u2019s transformation would undermine the unusual symbiosis among its diverse groups, gentrifying the South and some North Zone hilltops and pushing westwards those unable to afford these areas. It seemed as though the historic port area, almost wholly restricted to office buildings, museums and cruise ship services (including tourism), would remain mostly dark and silent at night and on weekends.<\/p>\n<p>This may still happen. But politicians have demonstrated increased sensitivity to voters. Some backtracking has occurred, and new dialogues are under way. Growing foreign interest and pressure, together with better access to information and a sense that real change is possible, are fuelling the process.<\/p>\n<p>Notably, significant give and take, particularly on the subjects of mobility and housing, has begun between city hall and the local chapter of the Brazilian Architects\u2019 Institute, which represents the city\u2019s top architects and planners. The mayor\u2019s July decision to allow urban renewal for residents of Vila Aut\u00f3dromo, an informal settlement previously in the path of Olympic Village bulldozers, indicates the possibility of preserving, in some cases, the positive features of informal settlements. And the governor is rethinking plans to privatise the renovated Maracan\u00e3 football stadium, set to exclude less prosperous sports enthusiasts and slated to demolish a public school, a swimming complex and a building used by Brazilian indigenous groups.<\/p>\n<p>Rio\u2019s citizens and media (and, perhaps, the politicians themselves) have begun to understand that politics need not be quite so \u2018dirty\u2019. In fact, what\u2019s occurring in Rio de Janeiro is a transition away from a favour-exchanging populist system towards a more complete participatory democracy. And this, though messy and unpredictable, can only bode well for one of the world\u2019s most charming and unique cities.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"<p><sup>1<\/sup> United States Department of State, Bureau of Diplomatic Security, OSAC.

However, the scholarly literature on the city and several of its main instruments of urban policy insist on another image: one that contrasts a rich and well-equipped centre with a poor and precarious periphery. According to this view, the city is made not only of opposed social and spatial worlds but also of clear distances between them. Since these imaginaries are contradictory \u2013 one pointing to the obscene neighbouring of poverty and wealth and another to a great distance between them \u2013 can both represent the city? If so, how well?<\/p>\n<p>Undoubtedly, S\u00e3o Paulo has always been a city marked by sharp social inequalities. However, in the last few decades, the multiple meanings of inequality, the quality of urban space, and the distribution of social groups across the city have changed considerably. The peripheries have improved and some of the physical inequalities between spaces have been reduced as the peripheries have improved. Yet the city that no longer believes in progress \u2013 as it did during the second half of the twentieth century and where violence and fear came to occupy the central stage in citizen\u2019s lives \u2013 is now a city in which the markers setting social worlds apart are carefully and emphatically drawn. It is also a city in which the public space abandoned by most is reinvented as space of contestation inscribed on its walls.<\/p>\n<p>S\u00e3o Paulo is a complex city that will not be captured by simplistic dual models: neither of the proximity nor of the distance of its opposed social groups. Together, both pictures represent the city. In isolation, neither can capture the pattern of spatial and social inequality that structures the metropolis today. These images are the result of two historical processes that have now coalesced and their material expressions are superimposed in the spaces of the city. The view of the rich centre versus the poor periphery corresponds with the pattern of urbanisation consolidated around the 1940s that dominated the city up to the 1980s. During this period, S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s urbanised area expanded dramatically due to the spread of auto-construction. Workers moved to the city by the millions and settled in non-urbanised areas on the outskirts. They bought cheap lots of land in areas without infrastructure and spent decades of savings and family work to build and improve their dream houses. In S\u00e3o Paulo, as elsewhere in Brazil and in the developing world, workers have always understood that illegality and precariousness are the conditions under which they become property owners and inhabit the modern city. The middle and upper classes remained in the centre and benefited from good infrastructure and services, and regularised and subsidised access to land. Thus, metropolitan regions have been marked by a dichotomy between the \u2018legal city\u2019, the centre inhabited by the upper classes, and the precarious peripheries.<\/p>\n<p>However, since the 1970s this neat separation started to be transformed by processes affecting both the centre and the periphery. One of the main sources was the organisation of social movements by residents of the peripheries. These urban activists, a majority of them women, were new property owners who realised that political organisation was the only way to force city authorities to extend urban infrastructure and services to their neighbourhoods. These social movements contributed significantly to the democratisation process and a new concept of citizenship. They also provoked a significant transformation in the urban environment of the peripheries. The state administrators responded to their demands and the city of S\u00e3o Paulo, among many others in Brazil, borrowed heavily to invest in urban infrastructure. As a consequence, the peripheries substantially improved road access, as well as sewage, sanitation, and electricity. These improvements sharply reduced infant mortality rates. As a result many neighbourhoods in the peripheries that began as \u2018bush\u2019 just a few decades ago have been completely urbanised. Although the urban social movements started to diminish in the 1990s, S\u00e3o Paulo remains highly organised. NGOs and associations of all forms, from religious to artistic \u2013 not to mention criminal \u2013 are everywhere. These heterogeneous associations signify the consolidation of democracy and the civic engagement of citizens.<\/p>\n<p>A second process that transformed the centre-periphery pattern started in the centre. Beginning in the 1970s, wealth steadily moved away. On the one hand, a new business pole was formed in the south-western zone of the city along the Pinheiros River which today concentrates high-end office complexes, shopping malls, media headquarters, hotels, and new cultural centres. On the other, some of the middle and upper classes began to retreat from the centre and its public space. Fear of violent crime \u2013 which grew from the mid-1980s to the late 1990s \u2013 was their main justification for migration by the hundreds of thousands. They built fortified enclaves for home, leisure, and work in areas where only the poor had lived before and from where they were not entirely expelled, as in the case of Parais\u00f3polis. Thus, the dramatic proximity of wealth and poverty is a recent phenomenon caused by the voluntary displacement of the upper classes.<\/p>\n<p>Although the image of the favela side-by-side with luxury apartments outside of the centre captures a recent configuration of social inequality in S\u00e3o Paulo, it misses important factors. Favelas are not the type of housing in which the majority of S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s poor live, and the heterogeneous peripheries cannot be described by the term favela. What distinguishes them is home ownership. Although there are many conditions of illegality and irregularity, the majority have bought the land on which they built their houses and have claims to ownership. Favela residents also own their homes, but not the land, which has typically been invaded. Moreover, the increase in homeownership in the municipality of S\u00e3o Paulo from 19 per cent in 1920 to 69 per cent in 2000 is due to high rates in the peripheries rather than in the central wealthy districts. In many of the poorest neighbourhoods, it is more than 80 per cent. Approximately 10 per cent of S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s population lives in favelas, while Rio de Janeiro and a few other Brazilian cities have an exceptionally high percentage of favela residents. Yet, if the view of the centre distant from the periphery misses the new developments that have brought people from radically different social conditions to live side by side, the picture that features this proximity misses the complexity of the peripheries and their significant improvement.<\/p>\n<p>Increased violent crime and fear have also provoked dramatic changes in the space and quality of everyday life across the city since the mid-1980s. The circulation of fear and discourses about violence have created the idiom under which polarised representations proliferate and dualistic and simplistic representations of inequality and are framed.<\/p>\n<p>Violent crime increased substantially from the mid-1980s to the late 1990s. With an overall annual murder rate of more than 60 per 100,000 people in the late 1990s, S\u00e3o Paulo became one of the most violent cities in the world. However, violence is distributed unevenly. Many of the neighbourhoods in the peripheries had a murder rate of more than 110 per 100,000 people, compared to less than fifteen in the city\u2019s central districts. The main victims of murder are young men, especially black. Moreover, most of the outrageously high number of cases of police abuse and killings happen in the peripheries. In the 2000s, violent crime rates decreased from 57.3 per 100,000 people in 2000 to 12.1 in 2007, which includes decreases in the peripheries. But it is not yet clear what this change will generate in terms of representation as the city still seems to operate under the stereotypical mode of the talk of crime.<\/p>\n<p>Conversations about crime have been common since the 1980s. Amid the chaotic feelings associated with the spread of random violence people talk. Contrary to the experience of crime, which disrupts meaning and disorders the world, the talk of crime symbolically reorders it by trying to re-establish a static picture of the world which is expressed in simplistic terms and clear-cut oppositional categories, the most important of which are good and evil. Such reductions and caricatures are central mechanisms associated with the talk of crime. Like other everyday practices dealing with violence, crime stories try to recreate a stable map for a world that has been shaken. These narratives impose partitions, build up walls, establish distances, segregate, impose prohibitions, and restrict movements. In short, they simplify and enclose the world, elaborating prejudices and eliminating ambiguities.<\/p>\n<p>Fear and the talk of crime also organise the urban landscape and public space, generating new forms of spatial segregation and social discrimination. Their most emblematic form is the fortified enclave. These are privatised, enclosed, and monitored spaces for residence, consumption, leisure, and work structured by the discourse of security. They can be shopping malls, office complexes, residential gated communities, and edge cities. They depend on private guards and high-tech security for protection and for enforcing exclusionary practices that guarantee their social exclusivity. They reproduce inequality both as a value and as a social fact. They treat what is enclosed and private as a form of distinction. As this logic becomes dominant, it spreads throughout the city. Walls are now everywhere, even in the most remote areas of the peripheries, not only to protect from crime, but also to distinguish neighbours from each other and express claims of social belonging.<\/p>\n<p>It is in this context of simplifications and stereotypical interpretations anchored in the fear of crime that the heterogeneous peripheries of S\u00e3o Paulo started to be called favelas, a process that obscures their significant urban and social improvements. The tendency to homogenise the conditions and spaces of poverty and to identify them with their worst configurations is now widespread. It is found in several recent Brazilian films that make poverty and favela, blackness and violent crime coincide. The iconic example is City of God. It is also the procedure Mike Davis uses in Planet of Slums to reduce the most diverse urban housing conditions of the poor worldwide to a single symbol of the worst: the slum.<\/p>\n<p>This tendency is also reproduced by residents of the periphery themselves. In important ways, S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s rap music elaborates a dichotomy between there and here and the denunciation of the inequality that exists between them. Rap articulates the experience of young men in contemporary peripheries growing up in a context of high violence and few chances for inclusion in the formal markets. Hip-hop wants to save their lives and contain violence. By portraying the conditions of the poor in the peripheries, and critically incorporating the prejudices usually voiced against their young and black residents, rappers articulate a powerful social critique. They denounce racism, express an explicit class antagonism, and create a style of confrontation that leaves very little space for tolerance and negotiation. Their raps establish a non-bridgeable and non-negotiable distance between rich and poor, white and black, the centre and the periphery, and articulate a position of enclosure. They think of the periphery as a world apart, something similar to the American ghetto, an imaginary that has never been used before in Brazil in relation to the peripheries, whose residents have always considered themselves unprivileged but nevertheless an integral part of the whole city. As one of the most famous rap groups, the Racionais MC\u2019s, put it in the rap \u2018Da Ponte pra c\u00e1\u2019 (\u2018On this side of the bridge\u2019):<\/p>\n<p>in the party with us you don\u2019t go<br \/> We here, you there; each one in his place<br \/> Did you get it?<br \/> If life is like this, am I to blame?<br \/> The world is different on this side of the bridge.<\/p>\n<p>As hip-hop followers reflect on the conditions of life on the outskirts of the city, they transform the quite diverse peripheries into a symbol: a periferia. As this new symbol, the periphery is homogenised to represent the worst social inequalities and violence. This transformed space of despair contrasts sharply with the image of improvement and mobility that dominated its representation from the 1940s to the 1990s. It is also sometimes called favela, not to describe the peripheries but to refer to its poor conditions which are re-signified to represent and denounce poverty in general.<\/p>\n<p>The construction of clear and non-negotiable social separations, the circulation of imaginairies despair, the construction of left-over spaces, and the use of stereotypical symbols to represent opposed social worlds is nowadays found on both sides of Brazilian society. Rappers\u2019 construction of self-enclosure is paralleled by upper-class practices of enclosure. Dichotomisation, simplification, and intolerance structure the imaginaries on both sides.<\/p>\n<p>Fear, the talk of crime, and the adoption of walls and separations all transform the character of public space. Privatisation, enclosures, policing of boundaries and distancing devices create a fragmented public space in which inequality is an organising value. Even so, this left-over public space has not remained empty or unmarked. In S\u00e3o Paulo, in addition to walls and fences, graffiti and pixa\u00e7\u00f5es proliferate on almost every street. These public inscriptions are usurpations that recreate a public domain in a city privatised by walls. Graffiti and pixa\u00e7\u00e3o reclaim the streets, the fa\u00e7ades, and the walls as spaces of communication and contestation instead of separation. Most graffiti artists and pixadores are young men from the peripheries. Through their inscriptions, they transgress, ignore boundaries, and appropriate spaces to mark their discrimination. Obviously, many interpret these appropriations as vandalism, crime, and proof of the deterioration of the public space.<\/p>\n<p>Although both graffiti and pixa\u00e7\u00e3o have similar roots, they constitute different types of intervention in public space. Graffiti is represented frequently on large public surfaces such as viaducts and tunnels. It is accepted as a type of public art authorised by the city, and occasionally sponsored by private institutions. Several graffiti artists from S\u00e3o Paulo are known internationally, and a few sell their art in private galleries for high prices.<\/p>\n<p>But if graffiti can be assimilated into the imaginary of art and beauty, pixa\u00e7\u00e3o has remained much more transgressive. Pixa\u00e7\u00e3o is equivalent to the American tagging, the writing of words, especially names, in public spaces. It is conceived by its practitioners as an anarchic intervention and as a radical urban sport, an urban alpinism. Pixadores inscribe the most impossible of spaces and are never sponsored by City Hall. Instead, they are targets of police harassment and the general population\u2019s disdain, who think that they deteriorate and deface, not improve, public space. For pixadores, though, their intervention signals the character of a public with few other forms of belonging. With pixa\u00e7\u00e3o and graffiti, those who have been kept outside of the dominant cultural systems master writing and painting in the same way that rappers master rhyming. They invent new styles, spreading signs of their transgressions and powerfully transforming the character of public space.<\/p>\n<p>Graffiti such as that on Rua Cardeal Arcoverde defines the streetscape experience of Vila Madalena, S\u00e3o Paulo.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_77\" style=\"width: 406px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-77\" title=\"14_SA08Ref_Caldeira2\" src=\"http:\/\/lsecities.net\/files\/2011\/08\/14_SA08Ref_Caldeira2.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"396\" height=\"278\" \/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Graffiti such as that on Rua Cardeal Arcoverde defines the streetscape experience of Vila Madalena, S\u00e3o Paulo.<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Together, walls, fences, fortified enclaves, raps, graffiti, and pixa\u00e7\u00f5es configure public space with unmistakable signs of social inequality and social tension. When the city was growing and violence was not an issue, the imagination that dominated the city was one of social mobility, improvement, expansion, and incorporation. Distances embodied spatially and socially were relatively unmarked symbolically. They had to remain fluid to anchor the strong belief in social mobility. Nowadays, inequalities and differences are prominently produced and are rarely left unmarked. Exaggerated and simplified, they mask processes of transformation and of improvement, and inevitably amplify the tension among social groups. Inequality has become naturalised, the taken-for-granted part of everyday life, the matter of social communication, even while it is denounced by unexpected interventions. Therefore, it is the tense and multi-layered production and contestation of inequality that we should look at to capture both the city\u2019s predicament and its vitality.<\/p>\n","article_extra_content":"","pdf_uri":"http:\/\/v0.urban-age.net\/0_downloads\/archive\/_SA\/15_NewsPaper_Essay_Caldeira.pdf","article_publishing_date":"December 2008","article_tags":false,"article_authors":[{"id":"14","name":"Teresa","created":"2011-08-31 09:11:30","modified":"2011-08-31 10:11:30","slug":"teresa","family_name":"Caldeira","title":null,"email_address":null,"photo_legacy":null,"profile_text":"","organization":"","role":"","additional_affiliations":null,"qualifications":null,"staff_pages_blurb":null,"office_location":null,"display_after":null,"display_until":null,"extended_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_blurb":null,"special_2012ec_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation":null,"special_2013rio_blurb_lang2":null,"special_2013rio_affiliation_lang2":null,"phone_number":null}],"attachments":false,"gallery":{"slug":false,"extra_classes":"","slides":[]}}]}
