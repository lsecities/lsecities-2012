This folder contains Pods 1.x helper code.

This code is not actually used directly by Pods 1.x as this version only supports
helpers managed directly through the Pods web admin interface.

However, we are keeping in this folder a copy of the helpers in use.

When upgrading to Pods 2.x, this code should be useful for action hooks, which
replace v1.x helpers and can be integrated directly in the theme and managed
via git.
